The outside diameter of the Cyr Wheel needs to be around 40-50mm depending on the preferred grip of the performer who\u2019s going to be using it.</p> <p>The diameter of the whole Cyr Wheel should be such that the performer can stand on the bottom of the wheel and have about a fist (10-15cm) gap above their head. So the internal diameter of the wheel needs to be the performers height + 10-15cm. The original wheel I made for Donna is a bit small, so we\u2019ll be making a new one with a larger diameter.</p> <p>The main wheel material I used was 1 \u00bc\u2033 (31.75mm) O.D. aluminium with a wall thickness of 10SWG (~3.25mm), and I got some tube to fit inside that to make the connections between the three sections of the wheel, this tube was 1\u2033 (25.4mm) O.D. with a wall thickness of 3/16\u2033 (4.76mm) which will be directly drilled and tapped. Later on I\u2019ll insert steel threaded sections so that the wheel can be held together tighter.</p> <p>The metal was rolled using a square former, because, well, that\u2019s all we had! It helped us not get much twist, but it did mean there was some deforming of the tube. The deformation however was very much limited to the smaller radius side of the tube, and thus won\u2019t affect the rolling or performance of the wheel.</p> <p>We rolled the tube to size by chalking out a half circle of the required size with a piece of string (well, a tape measure actually) holding the end at the centre point and rotating it a little and then marking it. This is the tube after it\u2019s been rolled:</p> <p></p> <p>As you can see, we start off with too much material, but I cut each section to a reasonable size which was still too big, but are all rolled section, with square ends so the tube can be laid out, and measured:</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The overlap is measured, divided by 3 and then that much is chopped off of each section. so that each section is the same size, and altogether they make a complete circle. You can see the deformed tube shape below which shows how well the external diameter radius has survived the rolling with square formers. If you\u2019re using round formers for the rolling then you won\u2019t have much distortion so you\u2019ll be okay!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Now that we have the wheel basics together, we need to create the connecting pieces. These will connect the three pieces of the wheel together and allow it to be broken down for easier transport. You can use as many pieces as you want. Traditionally Cyr Wheels have come in three piece form, but there are newer designs which break down into five piece. The more pieces the better actually, because getting the PVC hose on the outside as the protective layer is really hard to do over one of a three piece wheel.</p> <p>Normally, we\u2019d turn the smaller diameter round tube down a little to give it some play and fit curved sections of it, around 200mm long into the larger diameter tube that makes up the wheel. However, as the tube is distorted I had to match the shape of the inner tube to the outer tube on the milling machine. The pieces are about 200mm long, and were curved on a fly press until they fitted easily inside the tube. Note: You\u2019ll have to make them a slightly sloppy fit in order to be able to fit all the pieces of the wheel together. If you make the fit too tight you\u2019ll struggle to the get the wheel to assemble completely.</p> <p></p> <p>Eventually when we\u2019ve done three of them, we end up with what is the basis of our wheel, with three curved sections with fixings in one end of each:</p> <p></p> <p>The hoop is put together as a whole and then the fixing sections are drilled and tapped with the wheel completely assembled:</p> <p></p> <p>Now the wheel can be assembled and bolted together. It\u2019s worth checking now that the fit is tight enough. Try to hang from the top of the wheel with it all fixed together, the wheel should not flex or deform. It should take your weight easily as much more energy is put into the wheel when it is used.</p> <p></p> <p>Putting the outer PVC hose on is a bit of a trial! I also had to sand the marks from the square formers used for rolling, hence the DA sander is out! I used heat and soapy water as well as attaching the hose to the air line and blocking off the other end of the wheel section. This was meant to create a cushion of air to ease fitting the hose, but the hose is a pretty tough nut to crack. Besides, it becomes hard on a large section to apply force the hose whilst steadying the wheel tube. In the end I did two pieces of hose (one from each end) on the sections of the first wheel! Trying to do it in one piece just wasn\u2019t happening!</p> <p></p> <p>After all this you\u2019ll probably find you\u2019ve got one happy Fiance, but you\u2019ve also made the wheel a bit small and so need to make another one. Luckily you\u2019ve learnt from the first one and will make the second one even better! \ud83d\ude00</p> <p>And finally we\u2019ve got the rest of the hose on and Donna has booked a Cyr wheel workshop for October 2013 so she\u2019s been getting in some initial practice. Although here she\u2019s making it tougher by using flip-flops! This is when the wheel first made it home in a complete form.

Remembering the above, we could always define a macro, something like:</p> <pre><code>#ifndef LOG_H\n#define LOG_H\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#define DBG(x, ...) fprintf( stdout, \"%s: \" x \"\\n\", \"DBG\", ##__VA_ARGS__)\n#endif\n</code></pre> <p>This works well, it means we can just add this to our code. It takes advantage of the fact that string constants placed next to each other are concatenated by the compiler.</p> <pre><code>/* ... */\nDBG( \"This was an error! %s\", errorString );\n/* ... */\n</code></pre> <p>But when we want that error message to show us where we will find it in the source code, we can define debug differently:</p> <pre><code>#ifndef LOG_H\n#define LOG_H\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#define DBG(x, ...) fprintf( stdout, \"%s:%s:%d: \" x \"\\n\", \"DBG\", __func__, __LINE__, ##__VA_ARGS__)\n#endif\n</code></pre> <p>So now we have a pretty good debug definition. However, the usual approach to building software projects is to have a debug build where this debug information is printed, and a release version where this debug information is not printed. For the best performing release version we ideally just want DBG() to be blank. So we can test for a DEBUG definition and choose whether to use a functional DBG() or not:</p> <pre><code>#ifndef LOG_H\n#define LOG_H\n#if DEBUG\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#define DBG(x, ...) fprintf( stdout, \"%s:%s:%d: \" x \"\\n\", \"DBG\", __func__, __LINE__, ##__VA_ARGS__)\n#else\n#define DBG(x, ...)\n#endif\n#endif\n</code></pre> <p>There are more problems, we\u2019re not done yet! Consider the common C programming idiom:</p> <pre><code>if( something )\nDBG(\"Something should really be nothing, but it's %d\", something);\n</code></pre> <p>free( buffer ); When this is compiled in debug mode (i.e. DEBUG is defined), everything works fine because DBG compiles to a C statement. However, in release mode DBG() is compiled to nothing and we end up with a memory leak because the code in release mode becomes:</p> <pre><code>if( something )\nfree( buffer );\n</code></pre> <p>Definitely not what we intended! Some may say that this is a lesson learnt in always putting code block sharp braces after an if statement. I disagree with that! What it does teach us is that textual substitution by the C pre-processor should be considered carefully! Using sharp braces to block a single statement after an if statement makes the code much less readable for me. So we end up modifying the code to the following definitions in the header:</p> <pre><code>#ifndef LOG_H\n#define LOG_H\n#if DEBUG\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#define DBG(x, ...) { fprintf( stdout, \"%s:%s:%d: \" x \"\\n\", \"DBG\", __func__, __LINE__, ##__VA_ARGS__) }\n#else\n#define DBG(x, ...) { }\n#endif\n#endif\n</code></pre> <p>The more observant (perhaps sad?) people will observe that now we\u2019re inserting a semi-colon after a code block closing sharp bracket. But this is totally legal to end a statement. So with this version, we shoudl br all good to go?</p> <p>Not Quite!</p> <p>There\u2019s a place where a semi-colon after a block breaks compilation, and that\u2019s in an if\u2026else block. A semi-colon cannot be between the end of an if block statement and an else statement. So the following will break:</p> <pre><code>if( something )\nDBG( \"Opps, there'll be an error here!\" );\nelse\nDBG( \"Not Something!\" );\n</code></pre> <p>There is a quick trick we can perform to get around this, ensuring that having the semi-colon at the end of the line will always perform the same in all situations, and that\u2019s enclosing everything in a <code>do...while</code> loop:</p> <pre><code>#ifndef LOG_H\n#define LOG_H\n#if DEBUG\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#define DBG(x, ...) do { fprintf( stdout, \"%s:%s:%d: \" x \"\\n\", \"DBG\", __func__, \\\n                __LINE__, ##__VA_ARGS__) } while (0)\n#else\n#define DBG(x, ...) do { } while(0);\n#endif\n#endif\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>do...while</code> loop guarantee\u2019s at least one execution of the statement block. The compiler should drop the empty statement block as there\u2019s nothing to do. The one with the logging functionality should also boil down through the compiler to just the single fprintf call with no further checking around it. Otherwise, the compiler is not very optimal! This solution works in all cases and should allow us to write seamless debug printing code.</p> <p>Now you can add different logging levels and perhaps an error macro which will log to stderr instead of stdout.</p>"},{"location":"open-software/posix-shell-scripting/","title":"Posix Shell Scripting","text":"<p>Some neat tricks and methods for scripting.</p>"},{"location":"open-software/posix-shell-scripting/#directory-of-the-script","title":"Directory of the Script","text":"<p>At the start of my scripts is always the same line:</p> <pre><code>scriptdir=$(CDPATH= cd -- \"$(dirname -- \"$0\")\" &amp;&amp; pwd)\n</code></pre> <p>Looks odd?

Two strongly named functions cannot be present in code objects being linked. This would be an error produced by the linker \u2013 it doesn\u2019t know how to resolve two symbols with the same name. A simple example of this would be to compile two copies of the same file, which works fine, and then try to link them \u2013 this will then fail because there are multiple definitions for the same symbol.</p> <p>Weak functions are usually blank. Normally they are found in libraries that will be linked with application code. They provide a basis for optional extended functionality. The application layer can choose to implement these functions or not. To implement them the application layer simply defines a strong function for the name which the linker will then link in preference to the weak named function.</p> <p>Here is the GCC manual extract for the weak function attribute</p> <p>weak The weak attribute causes the declaration to be emitted as a weak symbol rather than a global. This is primarily useful in defining library functions that can be overridden in user code, though it can also be used with non-function declarations. Weak symbols are supported for ELF targets, and also for a.out targets when using the GNU assembler and linker</p> <p>So in GCC we can define a weak function by using the following syntax</p> <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\nvoid onKeypress(char c) __attribute__((weak))\n{\n}\nvoid* KeyboardScanThread(void* args)\n{\nchar c;\nwhile(!threadQuit)\n{\nc = getch();\nonKeypress(c);\n}\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Here we see an excerpt of psuedo code where the library is running a thread which continually scans the keyboard. After each key press onKeypress is called with the character that was pressed. If this library is linked with an application that does not have a strong onKeypress function, the blank weak function is used from the library. Generally the optimiser will eliminate this call anyway (though in embedded versions of GCC it will make that blank call, as I\u2019ve seen!)</p> <p>Now lets say the application does want to know when the q button has been pressed, and then we\u2019ll quit the library. All the application needs to do is have a strong onKeypress function. Here\u2019s a quick bit of psuedo-code that does that:</p> <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\nvoid onKeypress(char c)\n{\nif((c == 'q') || (c == 'Q'))\n{\nLibraryQuitNow();\n}\n}\nint main(int argc, char* argv[])\n{\nLibraryInit();\nwhile(!LibraryHasQuit())\n{\n}\nreturn EXIT_SUCCESS;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>It is important to note in the psuedo-code that we\u2019ve introduced cross-thread complications here. It is only as I\u2019m typing off the top of my head to find an example. There are of course times we might want to use this in a single-threaded environment too. Here we\u2019re just looking at the difference between weak and strong functions and looking at how we can use the weak function attribute in GCC.</p> <p>Now the linker resolves the strong function when linking and throws the weak function away.</p>"},{"location":"open-software/gcc/weak-function-attributes/#aliasing-a-weak-function","title":"Aliasing a weak function","text":"<p>Normally we alias all weak functions to a single blank function in GCC. This saves codespace when we have a lot of these weak functions as they are generally all blank. To alias a function in GCC we simply add in another function attribute, alias.</p> <p>This is what the GCC manual has to say about the alias function attribute:</p> <p><code>alias (\u201ctarget\u201d)</code> The alias attribute causes the declaration to be emitted as an alias for another symbol, which must be specified. For instance, <pre><code>void __f () { /* Do something. */; }\nvoid f () __attribute__ ((weak, alias (\"__f\")));\n</code></pre> defines <code>f</code> to be a weak alias for <code>__f</code>. In C++, the mangled name for the target must be used. It is an error if <code>__f</code> is not defined in the same translation unit.</p> <p>Not all target machines support this attribute.</p> <p>In fact, as you can see weak and alias are used together so much, the alias example is the example we need in this section of our documentation. Putting it in the context of our keyboard scanner above. If we altered the library so that we had a callback for each character, we would end up with a lot of blank functions in the library (assuming in this case that the optimiser didn\u2019t get rid of the calls!). But if we do this with aliasing we can have a single blank function which all the weak symbols will resolve too:</p> <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\nvoid onKeyBlank(void)\n{\n}\nvoid onKeyA() __attribute__((weak, alias(\"onKeyBlank\")));\nvoid onKeyB() __attribute__((weak, alias(\"onKeyBlank\")));\nvoid onKeyC() __attribute__((weak, alias(\"onKeyBlank\")));\nvoid onKeyD() __attribute__((weak, alias(\"onKeyBlank\")));\nvoid onKeyE() __attribute__((weak, alias(\"onKeyBlank\")));\nvoid onKeyF() __attribute__((weak, alias(\"onKeyBlank\")));\nvoid onKeyG() __attribute__((weak, alias(\"onKeyBlank\")));\n/*  ...  */\nvoid* KeyboardScanThread(void* args)\n{\nchar c;\nwhile(!threadQuit)\n{\nc = getch();\nswitch(c)\n{\ncase 'A':\ncase 'a':\nonKeyA();\nbreak;\ncase 'B':\ncase 'b':\nonKeyB();\nbreak;\n/*  ...  */\ndefault:\nOnKeyBlank(c);\nbreak;\n}\n}\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Now our code would be slightly different in the main application code:</p> <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\nvoid onKeyQ(void)\n{\nLibraryQuitNow();\n}\nint main(int argc, char* argv[])\n{\nLibraryInit();\nwhile(!LibraryHasQuit())\n{\n}\nreturn EXIT_SUCCESS;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>As to the worth of this GCC extension, well that\u2019s where you\u2019ll have to do your own evaluation. I\u2019ve used it in the past when generating serial comms libraries in order to have events on fairly mundane errors or asserts within the code which only really need any attention in a debug build. We can then build a version which ignores (or doesn\u2019t explicitly) report these errors and assertions which will be our release build, and a slower debug build which may well take memory dumps or other diagnostic information. A conditional compile on a code module which has hooks for these events is all we need.</p> <p>It can be useful, but it can also be omitted or worked around if you don\u2019t appreciate gcc extensions (but then this whole page is a bit useless to you!)</p>"},{"location":"open-software/python/pylab/","title":"Pylab","text":"<p>Warning</p> <p>This is an old post and is probably out of date - but give it a go if it helps you out!</p> <p>PyLab is a collection of libraries for Python which includes numpy, scipy, and matplotlib.

The first N samples of filtered data are not valid so we do not plot.</p> <p>It's quick and we can get the result from our filter quickly.</p> <p>When you're looking at the plot you're probably thinking it'd be nice if the axis were now a bit more relevant. For example, the X Axis is the number of samples. As we'd probably like the X Axis to be time, we must adjust the x-Axis to suit</p> <p>In order to plot the time, we need to generate the time!

As we're applying a filter, it would be nice to see a frequency domain plot of the input signal and a similar one for the filtered signal.</p> <p>Working with Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) is also made pretty easy in pylab. I shan't go into the theory about FFT's as there is plenty of information available in almost every Digital Signal Processing (DSP) book. It is an essenial part of DSP work and it is worth having a good understanding of the FFT and how it behaves. Hence, having an interactive python shell to do FFT calculations for you and plotting the results is a good bonus and will set you on your way with understanding them.</p> <p>I highly recommend Understaing Digital Signal Processing for this subject as it is an awesome book to read: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Understanding-Digital-Signal-Processing-Richard/dp/0137027419/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1310391681&amp;sr=8-1</p> <p>The FFT creates a number of frequency bins. The FFT puts a value in each bin according to that frequency's energy level in the data. The FFT produces results of + and - frequencies! Make sure you understand that.</p> <p>So, let's continue where we left off, we still have datain which contains our input data and we want to do an fft of the data.</p> <p>The number of bins generated by the FFT is equivalent to the number of samples over which the FFT is performed. In actual fact the bins are mirrored around the nyquist frequency. So in fact if we are sampling at 8kHz and we do a 1024 FFT (powers of two are best for FFTs) we will end up with 512 bins equidistantly spread between 0 to fs/2.</p> <p>Let's FFT:</p> <pre><code>N=1024\nfreq = fft(datain[:N])\n</code></pre> <p>Well, that was pretty easy! But there is a bit more required yet! If you haven't already, go ahead and plot the fft result:</p> <pre><code>plot(freq)\n</code></pre> <p>First off, we get an error about discarding the imaginary part of the values. That is okay, that is essentially the phase and we are not really interested in the phase.</p> <p>But, we also have negative magnitudes! Let's fix that first before we do anything else:</p> <pre><code>plot(abs(freq))\n</code></pre> <p>Okay, that's a bit better, and abs gets rid of the complex part of the values too so there is now no warning from plot about discarding them. At least it now looks a bit more like we'd expect from an FFT. But there is another big problem, as I mentioned before an FFT should generate frequency bins between 0 and \u00b1 fs/2 so the x axis should read (if sampling at 8kHz) -4000 through to +4000. With that scale, the results should mirror around 0 on the x-axis.</p> <p>In actual fact it is quite easy to re-arrange the results from the FFT to produce what we want to plot</p> <p>Firstly, we need to create the X Axis, just like we did converting samples into time. Now though we want to convert bins into frequency. We do this by creating a range for the X axis:</p> <pre><code>f = numpy.linspace(-fs/2, fs/2, N)\n</code></pre> <p>Now we create a new array, re-arranging the results of the FFT so that negative values come first and then positive values. The actual results are the opposite way around!</p> <pre><code>freq2 = abs(concatenate((freq[N/2:], freq[:N/2])))\n</code></pre> <p>In most cases, the negative half of the plot can be disregarded as it is a mirror of the positive frequency half.

These days the C compiler pipes the assembly to the assembler so there is no intermediate file as creating files is a lot slower than passing data from one program to another through a pipe.</p> <p>The linker's job is to link everything into an executable file. The linker requires a linker script. The linker script tells the linker how to organise the various object files. The linker will resolve symbols to addresses when it has arranged all the objects according to the rules in the linker script.</p> <p>What we're getting close to here is that a C program isn't just the code we type. There are some fundamental things that must happen for C code to run. For example, some variables need to be initialised to certain values, and some variables need to be initialised to 0. This is all taken care of by an object file which is usually implicitly linked in by the linker because the linker script will include a reference to it.

The C compiler does most of the menial tasks for us to make life easier for us, but because we're embedded engineers (aren't we?) we MUST be aware of how the compiler, assembler and linker work at a very low level as we generally work with custom systems which we must describe intimately to the tool-chain.</p> <p>So there's a missing <code>_exit</code> symbol. This symbol is reference by the C library we're using. It is in-fact a system call. It's designed to be implemented by the OS. It would be called when a program terminates. In our case, we are our own OS at we're the only thing running, and in fact we will never exit so we do not need to really worry about it. System calls can be blank, they just merely need to be provided in order for the linker to resolve the symbol.</p> <p>So the C library has a requirement of system calls. Sometimes these are already implemented as blank functions, or implemented for fixed functionality. For a list of system calls see the newlib documentation on system calls. Newlib is an open source, and lightweight C library which can be compiled in many different flavours.</p> <p>The C library is what provides all of the C functionality found in standard C header files such as <code>stdio.h</code>, <code>stlib.h</code>, <code>string.h</code>, etc.</p> <p>At this point I want to note that the standard Hello World example won't work here without an OS, and it is exactly unimplemented system calls that prevent it from being our first example. The lowest part of <code>printf(...)</code> includes a write function <code>write</code> - this function is used by all of the functions in the C library that need to write to a file. In the case of printf, it needs to write to the file stdout. Generally when an OS is running stdout produces output visible on a screen which can then be piped to another file system file by the OS. Without an OS, stdout generally prints to a UART to so that you can see program output on a remote screen such as a PC running a terminal program. We will discuss write implementations later on in the tutorial series, let's move on...</p> <p>The easiest way to fix the link problem is to provide a minimal exit function to satisfy the linker. As it is never going to be used, all we need to do is shut the linker up and let it resolve <code>_exit</code>. So now, again with the <code>build.sh</code> script in <code>armc-01</code> we can compile the next version of the code, <code>part-1/armc-01.c</code></p> <pre><code>int main(void)\n{\nwhile(1)\n{\n}\nreturn 0;\n}\nvoid exit(int code)\n{\nwhile(1)\n;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>NOTE: In case you're wondering, the C compiler prefixes an underscore to the generated symbols for functions, so we don't include an underscore, otherwise we'd end up with a function that the linker sees as <code>__exit</code>. If we were writing this in an assembler file, we'd have to include the underscore prefix ourselves.</p> <p>As we can see, compilation is successful and we get a <code>kernel*.elf</code> file generated by the compiler. Currently, that elf file is 37k.</p> <pre><code>part-1/armc-01 $ ./build.sh rpi3\n\narm-none-eabi-gcc -mfloat-abi=hard \\\n-mfpu=crypto-neon-fp-armv8 \\\n-march=armv8-a+crc \\\n-mcpu=cortex-a53 \\\narmc-01.c \\\n-o kernel.armc-01.rpi3.elf\n</code></pre> <pre><code>part-1/armc-01 $ ls -lh\ntotal 16K\n-rw-r--r-- 1 brian brian  366 Sep 21 00:19 armc-01.c\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 brian brian 2.3K Sep 21 00:45 build.sh\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 brian brian  36K Sep 21 00:45 kernel.armc-01.rpi3.elf\n</code></pre> <p>It's important to have an infinite loop in the exit function.

Yes, that's a bit oxymoronic!</p> <p>Now using the same build command above we get a clean build! Yay! But there is really a problem, in order to provide a system underneath the C library we will have to provide linker scripts and our own C Startup code.

The bootcode.bin bootloader in turn searches the SD card for a file called start.elf and a config.txt file to set various kernel settings before searching the SD card again for a kernel.img file which it then loads into memory at a specific address (0x8000) and starts the ARM processor executing at that memory location. The GPU is now up and running and the ARM will start to come up using the code contained in kernel.img. The start.elf file contains the code that runs on the GPU to provide most of the requirements of OpenGL, etc.</p> <p>Therefore in order to boot your own code, you need to firstly compile your code to an executable and name it kernel.img, and put it onto a FAT formatted SD Card, which has the GPU bootloader (bootcode.bin, and start.elf) on it as well. The latest Raspberry-Pi firmware is available on GitHub. The bootloader is located under the boot sub-directory. The rest of the firmware provided is closed-binary video drivers. They are compiled for use under Linux so that accelerated graphics drivers are available. As we're not using Linux these files are of no use to us, only the bootloader firmware is.</p> <p>All this means that the processor is already up and running when it starts to run our code. Clock sources and PLL settings are already decided and programmed in the bootloader which alleviates that problem from us. We get to just start messing with the devices registers from an already running core. This is something I'm not that used too, normally the first thing in my code would be setting up correct clock and PLL settings to initialise the processor, but the GPU has setup the basic clocking scheme for us.</p> <p>The first thing we will need to set up is the GPIO controller. There are no drivers we can rely on as there is no OS running, all the bootloader has done is boot the processor into a working state, ready to start loading the OS.</p> <p>You'll need to get the Raspberry-Pi BCM2835 peripherals datahsheet, and make sure you pay attention to the errata for that too as it's not perfect. This gives us the information we require to control the IO peripherals of the BCM2835. I'll guide us through using the GPIO peripheral - there are as always some gotcha's:</p> <p>The Raspberry-Pi 2B 1.2 uses the BMC2837 and so you'll want to get the Raspberry-Pi BCM2837 peripherals datahsheet.</p> <p>NOTE: The 2837 peripherals document is just a modified version of the original 2835 document with the addresses updated to suit the 2837's base peripheral address. See rpi issue 325 for further details.</p> <p>We'll be using the GPIO peripheral, and it would therefore be natural to jump straight to that documentation and start writing code, but we need to first read some of the 'basic' information about the processor. The important bit to note is the virtual address information. On page 5 of the BCM2835 peripherals page we see an IO map for the processor. Again, as embedded engineers we must have the IO map to know how to address peripherals on the processor and in some cases how to arrange our linker scripts when there are multiple address spaces.</p> <p></p> <p>The VC CPU Bus addresses relate to the Broadcom Video Core CPU. Although the Video Core CPU is what bootloads from the SD Card, execution is handed over to the ARM core by the time our <code>kernel.img</code> code is called. So we're not interested in the VC CPU Bus addresses.</p> <p>The ARM Physical addresses is the processors raw IO map when the ARM Memory Management Unit (MMU) is not being used. If the MMU is being used, the virtual address space is what what we'd be interested in.</p> <p>Before an OS kernel is running, the MMU is also not running as it has not been initialised and the core is running in kernel mode. Addresses on the bus are therefore accessed via their ARM Physical Address. We can see from the IO map that the VC CPU Address <code>0x7E000000</code> is mapped to ARM Physical Address <code>0x20000000</code> for the original Raspberry Pi. This is important!</p> <p>If you read the two peripheral datasheets carefully you'll see a subtle difference in them, notably , the Raspberry-Pi 2 has the ARM IO base set to <code>0x3F000000</code> instead of the original <code>0x20000000</code> of the original Raspberry-Pi. Unfortunately for us software engineers the Raspberry-Pi foundation don't appear to be good at securing the documentation we need, in fact, their attitude suggests they think we're magicians and don't actually need any. What a shame! Please if you're a member of the forum, campaign for more documentation. As engineers, especially in industry we wouldn't accept this from a manufacturer, we'd go elsewhere! In fact, we did at my work and use the TI Cortex A8 from the Beaglebone Black, a very good and well documented SoC!</p> <p>Anyway, the base address can be gleaned from searching for uboot patches. The Raspberry Pi 2 uses a BCM2836 so we can search for that and u-boot and we come along a patch for supporting the Raspberry-Pi 2.</p> <p>Further on in the manual we come across the GPIO peripheral section of the manual (Chapter 6, page 89).</p> <p>RPi4 has the peripheral base mapped to <code>0xFE000000</code>. The peripheral address space looks to be laid out the same as the previous pis.</p>"},{"location":"open-software/raspberry-pi/bare-metal-programming-in-c-part-1/#visual-output-and-running-code","title":"Visual Output and Running Code","text":"<p>Finally, let's get on and see some of our code running on the Raspberry-Pi. We'll continue with using the first example of the Cambridge tutorials by lighting the OK LED on the Raspberry-Pi board.</p> <p>The GPIO peripheral has a base address in the BCM2835 manual at <code>0x7E200000</code>. We know from getting to know our processor that this translates to an ARM Physical Address of <code>0x20200000</code> (<code>0x3F200000</code> for RPI2 and RPI3, and <code>0xFE200000</code> for RPI4). This is the first register in the GPIO peripheral register set, the <code>GPIO Function Select 0</code> register.</p> <p>In order to use an IO pin, we need to configure the GPIO peripheral. From the Raspberry-Pi schematic diagrams the OK LED is wired to the GPIO16 line (Sheet 2, B5) . The LED is wired active LOW - this is fairly standard practice. It means to turn the LED on we need to output a 0 (the pin is connected to 0V by the processor) and to turn it off we output a 1 (the pin is connected to VDD by the processor).</p> <p>Unfortunately, again, lack of documentation is rife and we don't have schematics for the Raspberry-Pi 2 or plus models! This is important because the GPIO lines were re-jigged and as Florin has noted in the comments section, the Raspberry Pi Plus configuration has the LED on GPIO47, so I've added the changes in brackets below for the RPI B+ models (Which includes the RPI 2).</p> <p>Back to the processor manual and we see that the first thing we need to do is set the GPIO pin to an output. This is done by setting the function of GPIO16 (GPIO47 RPI+) to an output.</p> <p>Bits 18 to 20 in the <code>GPIO Function Select 1</code> register control the GPIO16 pin.</p> <p>Bits 21 to 23 in the <code>GPIO Function Select 4</code> register control the GPIO47 pin. (RPI B+)</p> <p>Bits 27 to 29 in the <code>GPIO Function Select 2</code> register control the GPIO29 pin. (RPI3 B+) GPIO42 pin. (RPI4)</p> <p>In C, we will generate a pointer to the register and use the pointer to write a value into the register. We will mark the register as volatile so that the compiler explicitly does what I tell it to. If we do not mark the register as volatile, the compiler is free to see that we do not access this register again and so to all intents and purposes the data we write will not be used by the program and the optimiser is free to throw away the write because it has no effect.</p> <p>The effect however is definitely required, but is only externally visible (the mode of the GPIO pin changes). We inform the compiler through the volatile keyword to not take anything for granted on this variable and to simply do as I say with it:</p> <p>We will use pre-processor definitions to change the base address of the GPIO peripheral depending on what RPI model is being targeted.</p> <pre><code>#if defined( RPI0 ) || defined( RPI1 )\n#define GPIO_BASE       0x20200000UL\n#elif defined( RPI2 ) || defined( RPI3 )\n#define GPIO_BASE       0x3F200000UL\n#elif defined( RPI4 )\n#define GPIO_BASE       0xFE200000UL\n#else\n#error Unknown RPI Model!\n#endif\n</code></pre> <p>In order to set GPIO16 as an output then we need to write a value of 1 in the relevant bits of the function select register. Here we can rely on the fact that this register is set to 0 after a reset and so all we need to do is set:</p> <pre><code>/* Assign the address of the GPIO peripheral (Using ARM Physical Address) */\ngpio = (unsigned int*)GPIO_BASE;\ngpio[LED_GPFSEL] |= (1 &lt;&lt; LED_GPFBIT);\n</code></pre> <p>This code looks a bit messy, but we will tidy up and optimise later on. For now we just want to get to the point where we can light an LED and understand why it is lit!</p> <p>The ARM GPIO peripherals have an interesting way of doing IO. It's actually a bit different to most other processor IO implementations. There is a SET register and a CLEAR register. Writing 1 to any bits in the SET register will SET the corresponding GPIO pins to 1 (logic high), and writing 1 to any bits in the CLEAR register will CLEAR the corresponding GPIO pins to 0 (logic low). There are reasons for this implementation over a register where each bit is a pin and the bit value directly relates to the pins output level, but it's beyond the scope of this tutorial.</p> <p>So in order to light the LED we need to output a 0. We need to write a 1 to bit 16 in the CLEAR register:</p> <pre><code>*gpio_clear |= (1&lt;&lt;16);\n</code></pre> <p>Putting what we've learnt into the minimal example above gives us a program that compiles and links into an executable which should provide us with a Raspberry-Pi that lights the OK LED when it is powered.

The meta-data can be useful. In Linux and in fact most OS these days, running an executable doesn't mean the file gets loaded into memory and then the processor starts running from the address at which the file was loaded. There is usually an executable loader which uses formats like ELF to know more about the executable, for example the Function call interface might be different between different executables, this means that code can use different calling conventions which use different registers for different meanings when calling functions within a program. This can determine whether the executable loader will even allow the program to be loaded into memory or not. The ELF format meta-data can also include a list of all of the shared objects (SO, or DLL under Windows) that this executable also needs to have loaded.

In general, you'll select your processor or embedded system on the command line and the appropriate linker script and C-Runtime is chosen for you and linked in.</p> <p>I urge you to go and look at your <code>arm-none-gcc-eabi</code> install now to see some of these files. Look under the <code>arm-none-eabi</code> sub-directory and then under the lib sub-directory. The C-Runtime code is a binary object file and is called <code>crt0.o</code>, the C Library for info is an archive of object files called <code>libc.a</code> (there may be several versions with different names), and then you'll have some <code>.ld</code> files. Under the ldscripts subdirectory you'll find the standard linker scripts.</p> <p>It's just worth a look to know they're there. GCC uses a thing called specs files too, which allow specifying system settings so that you can create a machine specification that allows you to target a machine easily. You can select a custom specs file with a command line option for GCC, otherwise gcc uses it's built-in specs.</p> <p>specs files are considered an advanced subject in the world of the GNU tool-chain, but they provide an excellent way of supplying machine-specific compilation settings. For the embedded engineer they're worth knowing about! :D</p> <p>So, now we've got two questions, why does our code work - because the initialisation isn't present in the C-Runtime? and, why has our code size jumped from a 100 bytes or so to 64k?</p> <p>The code works without any initialisation because the variables exist in the same memory space as the code. The bootloading process results in the raspberry-pi kernel being loaded into RAM in order to be executed, the GPU bootloader runs before the ARM processor we're targeting runs, and loads the kernel.img file from disk. Because of this, the variables position within the binary image becomes their variable memory location.</p> <p>The image is loaded by the boot-loader at address <code>0x8000</code> and then executed. So the bootloader has essentially done a taskt that the C-Runtime would normally do, copy the initial values of initialised variables from non-volatile memory to volatile memory. Cool.</p> <p>Look at the code produced closer with a disassembler. You've already got a disassembler! It comes with the toolchain; Welcome to the world of objdump (or in our case <code>arm-non-eabi-objdump</code>).</p> <p>We disassemble the elf file because then objdump knows what processor the binary was built for. It also then has knowledge of the different code sections too. There's a <code>disassemble.sh</code> script so go ahead and disassemble the code to see what the compiler generated. You'll get a <code>kernel*.asm</code> file that looks similar to if not the same as the following (RPI0) code:</p> <pre><code>Disassembly of section .text:\n\n00008000 &lt;main&gt;:\n    8000:    e59f30b8     ldr    r3, [pc, #184]    ; 80c0 &lt;main+0xc0&gt;\n    8004:    e5933000     ldr    r3, [r3]\n    8008:    e2833004     add    r3, r3, #4\n    800c:    e5932000     ldr    r2, [r3]\n    8010:    e59f30a8     ldr    r3, [pc, #168]    ; 80c0 &lt;main+0xc0&gt;\n    8014:    e5933000     ldr    r3, [r3]\n    8018:    e2833004     add    r3, r3, #4\n    801c:    e3822701     orr    r2, r2, #262144    ; 0x40000\n    8020:    e5832000     str    r2, [r3]\n    8024:    e59f3098     ldr    r3, [pc, #152]    ; 80c4 &lt;main+0xc4&gt;\n    8028:    e3a02000     mov    r2, #0\n    802c:    e5832000     str    r2, [r3]\n    8030:    ea000004     b    8048 &lt;main+0x48&gt;\n    8034:    e59f3088     ldr    r3, [pc, #136]    ; 80c4 &lt;main+0xc4&gt;\n    8038:    e5933000     ldr    r3, [r3]\n    803c:    e2833001     add    r3, r3, #1\n    8040:    e59f207c     ldr    r2, [pc, #124]    ; 80c4 &lt;main+0xc4&gt;\n    8044:    e5823000     str    r3, [r2]\n    8048:    e59f3074     ldr    r3, [pc, #116]    ; 80c4 &lt;main+0xc4&gt;\n    804c:    e5933000     ldr    r3, [r3]\n    8050:    e59f2070     ldr    r2, [pc, #112]    ; 80c8 &lt;main+0xc8&gt;\n    8054:    e1530002     cmp    r3, r2\n    8058:    9afffff5     bls    8034 &lt;main+0x34&gt;\n    805c:    e59f305c     ldr    r3, [pc, #92]    ; 80c0 &lt;main+0xc0&gt;\n    8060:    e5933000     ldr    r3, [r3]\n    8064:    e2833028     add    r3, r3, #40    ; 0x28\n    8068:    e3a02801     mov    r2, #65536    ; 0x10000\n    806c:    e5832000     str    r2, [r3]\n    8070:    e59f304c     ldr    r3, [pc, #76]    ; 80c4 &lt;main+0xc4&gt;\n    8074:    e3a02000     mov    r2, #0\n    8078:    e5832000     str    r2, [r3]\n    807c:    ea000004     b    8094 &lt;main+0x94&gt;\n    8080:    e59f303c     ldr    r3, [pc, #60]    ; 80c4 &lt;main+0xc4&gt;\n    8084:    e5933000     ldr    r3, [r3]\n    8088:    e2833001     add    r3, r3, #1\n    808c:    e59f2030     ldr    r2, [pc, #48]    ; 80c4 &lt;main+0xc4&gt;\n    8090:    e5823000     str    r3, [r2]\n    8094:    e59f3028     ldr    r3, [pc, #40]    ; 80c4 &lt;main+0xc4&gt;\n    8098:    e5933000     ldr    r3, [r3]\n    809c:    e59f2024     ldr    r2, [pc, #36]    ; 80c8 &lt;main+0xc8&gt;\n    80a0:    e1530002     cmp    r3, r2\n    80a4:    9afffff5     bls    8080 &lt;main+0x80&gt;\n    80a8:    e59f3010     ldr    r3, [pc, #16]    ; 80c0 &lt;main+0xc0&gt;\n    80ac:    e5933000     ldr    r3, [r3]\n    80b0:    e283301c     add    r3, r3, #28\n    80b4:    e3a02801     mov    r2, #65536    ; 0x10000\n    80b8:    e5832000     str    r2, [r3]\n    80bc:    eaffffd8     b    8024 &lt;main+0x24    &gt;\n    80c0:    000180cc     andeq    r8, r1, ip, asr #1\n    80c4:    000180d0     ldrdeq    r8, [r1], -r0\n    80c8:    0007a11f     andeq    sl, r7, pc, lsl r1\n\nDisassembly of section .data:\n\n000180cc &lt;gpio&gt;:\n   180cc:    20200000     eorcs    r0, r0, r0\n\nDisassembly of section .bss:\n\n000180d0 &lt;tim&gt;:\n   180d0:    00000000     andeq    r0, r0, r0\n</code></pre> <p>NOTE: Unless we're using the exact same compiler, your mileage may vary here. So assume the assembly code above is what's come out of the compiler and follow the text below which goes through it in detail.</p> <p>Let's take it line by line. The toolchain's linker has decided that the entry point for the code should be at memory address <code>0x8000</code>. We see from the disassembled listing that this is where the machine code starts. Let's look at what it does.</p> <pre><code>00008000 &lt;main&gt;:\n    8000:    e59f30b8     ldr    r3, [pc, #184]    ; 80c0 &lt;main+0xc0&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>This first line loads r3 with the value at the address contained at the Program Counter (PC) + 184. In this assembler, <code>[]</code> is kind of an equivalent to dereferencing a pointer in C. So instead of loading r3 with the value <code>80c0</code> it will instead load r3 with the 32-bit value at memory location <code>0x80c0</code></p> <p>But wait a minute - if you do the maths of <code>0x8000 + 184</code> you get <code>0x80b8</code>. How come the disassembler is suggesting the data comes from <code>0x80c0</code>?</p> <p>Well PC relative addressing works slightly different to what you may expect and really there's a issue with it, the value of PC is different depending on whether the instruction set is currently ARM or Thumb. Further information is available on the ARM website.</p> <p>The important thing to note here is:</p> <p>In ARM state, the value of the PC is the address of the current instruction plus 8 bytes.</p> <p>In Thumb state:</p> <ul> <li> <p>For B, BL, CBNZ, and CBZ instructions, the value of the PC is the address of the current instruction plus 4 bytes.</p> </li> <li> <p>For all other instructions that use labels, the value of the PC is the address of the current instruction plus 4 bytes, with bit[1] of the result cleared to 0 to make it word-aligned.</p> </li> </ul> <p>We're in ARM instruction mode here. If you're not sure about ARM and Thumb instruction sets you can do some googling. Thumb (there's more than one Thumb mode!) are smaller width instructions to allow for more compact code which is very useful in heavily embedded systems.</p> <p>So actually the maths here sound be: <code>0x8000 + 0x8 + 0xb8 = 0x80c0</code> to get us to a memory address. At <code>0x80c0</code> there's the value <code>0x180cc</code> (<code>0x8000 + 0x80cc</code>):</p> <pre><code>80c0:    000180cc     andeq    r8, r1, ip, asr #1\n</code></pre> <p>You can ignore the disassembled version of this value as it's not machine code, instead it's merely a data value.</p> <p>The next line of the code loads r3 with the 32-bit value that's in memory at the address currently contained in r3. In c, this would look a bit horrid, but so you get the idea of what I've just explained, imagine something like this:</p> <pre><code>uint32_t r3 = 0x180cc;\nr3 = *(uint32_t*)r3;\n</code></pre> <p>At the address 0x180cc in our disassembled version there's the 32-bit value <code>0x20200000</code> which is the value we want the variable gpio initialised to (for the RPI1, for the RPI2 this will be <code>0x3F200000</code>. So this is why the code works without any explicit loading or initialisation, but let's look at exactly what's going on and find out why it works like this.</p> <p>The value at the end of our executable image can be viewed by dumping the hex and having a look at the plain machine code that's in the binary file. The disassemble script does this for you with a tool called <code>hexdump</code> and puts the result into a <code>kernel*.img.hexdump</code> file. It's a plain text file - you can go ahead and crack it open in a text editor or <code>cat</code> it.</p> <pre><code>0000000 30b8 e59f 3000 e593 3004 e283 2000 e593\n0000010 30a8 e59f 3000 e593 3004 e283 2701 e382\n0000020 2000 e583 3098 e59f 2000 e3a0 2000 e583\n0000030 0004 ea00 3088 e59f 3000 e593 3001 e283\n0000040 207c e59f 3000 e582 3074 e59f 3000 e593\n0000050 2070 e59f 0002 e153 fff5 9aff 305c e59f\n0000060 3000 e593 3028 e283 2801 e3a0 2000 e583\n0000070 304c e59f 2000 e3a0 2000 e583 0004 ea00\n0000080 303c e59f 3000 e593 3001 e283 2030 e59f\n0000090 3000 e582 3028 e59f 3000 e593 2024 e59f\n00000a0 0002 e153 fff5 9aff 3010 e59f 3000 e593\n00000b0 301c e283 2801 e3a0 2000 e583 ffd8 eaff\n00000c0 80cc 0001 80d0 0001 a11f 0007 0000 0000\n00000d0 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000\n*\n00100c0 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 2020\n00100d0\n</code></pre> <p>The binary is in little-endian format because the processor is little endian. Adjust the <code>GPIO_BASE</code> value, recompile and disassemble again so you can see the value change. Sure the code won't work properly, but you can prove to yourself you're looking (and making sense of) the right thing.</p> <p>The thing to note here is that our binary image ends at <code>0x100cf</code>. After the bootloader has placed this binary image in memory at <code>0x8000</code> the last memory location we touch is <code>0x180cf</code>.</p> <p>Let's have a quick look at what happens next:</p> <pre><code>8008:    e2833004     add    r3, r3, #4\n</code></pre> <p>Increase the value in r3 from <code>0x20200000</code> to <code>0x20200004</code> and store it in r3. This is part of the C line:</p> <pre><code>gpio[LED_GPFSEL] |= (1 &lt;&lt; LED_GPFBIT);\n</code></pre> <p>LED_GPFSEL for this compilation for the RPI Zero is set by:</p> <pre><code>#define LED_GPFSEL      GPIO_GPFSEL1\n#define GPIO_GPFSEL1    1\n</code></pre> <p>From the definition of <code>gpio</code> as <code>volatile unsigned int*</code> each item pointed to is an unsigned int which is 32-bit wide. That's 4 bytes, so we increase the pointer into gpio by 4 bytes to get the register address we require in r3.</p> <pre><code>800c:    e5932000     ldr    r2, [r3]\n</code></pre> <p>Load the value of <code>gpio[LED_GPFSEL]</code> into r2. This is common for read-modify-write operations such as the <code>|=</code> operator we're using in this example. We need to do exactly that, read the value, modify the value and then write the new value.</p> <pre><code>8010:    e59f30a8     ldr    r3, [pc, #168]    ; 80c0 &lt;main+0xc0&gt;\n8014:    e5933000     ldr    r3, [r3]\n8018:    e2833004     add    r3, r3, #4\n</code></pre> <p>The compiler being rather inefficient here. It's preparing r3 again to be the memory write destination which is exactly the same read memory location. Any sort of compiler optimisations should be able to get rid of the above three lines. They're really not required, but we understand what's going on still.</p> <pre><code>801c:    e3822701     orr    r2, r2, #262144    ; 0x40000\n</code></pre> <p>The modify part of <code>|=</code>. In this case <code>(1 &lt;&lt; LED_GPFBIT)</code> has been reduced to a constant. The original <code>gpio[LED_GPFSEL]</code> value is still in r2. We OR that value with the constant to set the bit and store the new value in r2. The ARM architecture cannot modify a register value and store it to a memory location in a single instruction BTW in case you're thinking that would serve us better.</p> <pre><code>8020:    e5832000     str    r2, [r3]\n</code></pre> <p>Finally, the write part of the read-modify-write operation is to write the new value back to the destination <code>gpio[LED_GPFSEL]</code></p> <pre><code>8024:    e59f3098     ldr    r3, [pc, #152]    ; 80c4 &lt;main+0xc4&gt;\n...\n80c4:    000180d0     ldrdeq    r8, [r1], -r0\n</code></pre> <p>Loads the value <code>0x180d0</code> into r3.</p> <p>This value is a problem! It is outside our binary image space. If we were to use this value it would be a random value that isn't within our control. How come?</p> <p>This memory location relates to the C variable <code>tim</code> in our program. This variable is determined by the C standard to have automatic storage duration and according to the C standard should therefore have a initialised value of 0, but we know here that this is not the case, instead we'll have a random value.</p> <p>Actually what happens in the code next is the <code>for</code> loop starts by setting the <code>tim</code> variable to <code>0</code>.</p> <pre><code>8028:    e3a02000     mov    r2, #0\n802c:    e5832000     str    r2, [r3]\n</code></pre> <p>Let's do a sanity check and make sure we're right by assuming that this is the <code>tim</code> variable:</p> <pre><code>000180d4 B __bss_end__\n000180d4 B _bss_end__\n000180d0 B __bss_start\n000180d0 B __bss_start__\n000180cc D __data_start\n000180d0 D _edata\n000180d4 B _end\n000180d4 B __end__\n000180cc D gpio\n00008000 T main\n00080000 N _stack\n         U _start\n000180d0 B tim\n</code></pre> <p>Yep!

Let's find out what we need to do to fix it instead. You can also see how complicated a linker script can get when it needs to deal with C++ sections!</p> <p>I hope you're staying with me! I know this may seem far removed from C development on the Raspberry-Pi bare-metal, but in fact knowing how your tools work to construct the code is essential later on down the line - heck you wouldn't be getting it up and running on your own from scratch unless you knew at least some of this stuff!</p> <p>Whilst I'm scan-reading the linker script I'm looking for things that stick out. Most of these sections are not used in our basic example so far, so whatever is messing with us must have a size set, and must be present only when we have something in the initialised variables section which we know from our investigations with nm is the <code>__data_start</code> section (it aligns with the gpio symbol which we initialised).</p> <p>The \"problem\" must be between the <code>__data_start</code> section and end of the text section (the symbol main indicated the start of the text section). After a little bit of hunting, I see a comment and an alignment pertaining to the data section on line 107:</p> <pre><code>/* Adjust the address for the data segment.  We want to adjust up to\n     the same address within the page on the next page up.  */\n. = ALIGN(CONSTANT (MAXPAGESIZE)) + (. &amp; (CONSTANT (MAXPAGESIZE) - 1));\n</code></pre> <p>Interesting, we apparently \"want\" to adjust up to the next page. If I comment this out with a standard C-style comment as can be seen in the rest of the file, we get back down to a size of a few hundred bytes with initialised data.

The <code>.bss</code> section is used for data that is implicitly initialised to 0 at startup (This is mandated by the C Standard). This means that all variables that are statically declared are set to zero initially. Statically declared essentially means global, so local (automatic) variables in a function that are not marked as static do not get initialised to zero if you do not explicitly add an initial value. It's easier with an example, take for example the following C file:</p> <pre><code>    unsigned int var1;\nunsigned int var2;\nunsigned int var3 = 10;\nvoid function( void )\n{\nunsigned int funcvar1;\nstatic unsigned int funcvar2;\n/* ... */\n}\n</code></pre> <p>In the above example var1, var2 and funcvar2 are in the bss section, the rest are not. For more information on the bss section, see the wikipedia page on it</p> <p>The linker organises the data and sorts it out into the different sections. In the above, var3 for example goes into the data section. The code is compiled into machine code and then put in the <code>.text</code> section. See here for \"a little!\" more information about the text section. There can be many text sections and there can be many data sections too. These sections are wild-carded in the linker script to ensure different sections can be defined whilst still knowing whether they are code or data sections.</p> <p>In our current code (armc-07) the bss section is not valid because it is not being initialised. That's because the C-Startup is missing. This is the importance of the <code>_start</code> symbol!</p> <p>The <code>_start</code> section is run before the c main() entry point and one of it's jobs is to initialise the bss section. The linker provides us with a couple of symbols for the sections so we know where they start and end. In the startup code all we need to do is loop between the addresses defined by <code>bss_start</code> and <code>bss_end</code> and set all locations to zero. It's easy when you know what you're meant to do!</p> <p>The <code>_startup</code> code should also setup the stack pointer. We'll need a working stack to get anything useful up and working! The stack is temporary memory space available for functions to use. The compiler tries to use registers for local (automatic) function variables, but if the size of data required by the local variables exceeds the amount of registers available, the compiler uses the stack for the local variables.</p> <p>So lets go ahead and setup the stack pointer to a sane value and initialise the bss section.</p> <p>Firstly, we'll set the linker script back to standard so the entry point is the <code>_start</code> symbol again, we'll have to generate this symbol and generally we'll need to do this is assembler. We need to setup the stack pointer before we enter the C code so that we're safe to write C which may attempt to use the stack straight away.</p> <p>Normally the complete startup is done in assembler, including zeroing the bss section, but it doesn't have to! I prefer to get into C as soon as possible, so let's see how little assembler we can get away with, and see what trips us up next!</p>"},{"location":"open-software/raspberry-pi/bare-metal-programming-in-c-part-2/#armc-08-starts","title":"armc-08-start.S","text":"<pre><code>.section \".text.startup\"\n\n.global _start\n\n_start:\n    // Set the stack pointer, which progresses downwards through memory\n    // Set it at 64MB which we know our application will not crash into\n    // and we also know will be available to the ARM CPU.

There's not exactly a lot there to set up the stack pointer. The stack is placed at the start of our program and grows downwards through memory. You don't need a large amount of memory for the stack.</p> <p>Some important information about the <code>.section</code> declaration. With the linker script, I can see in <code>rpi.x</code> that the following text sections are available:</p> <pre><code>.text           :\n{\n  *(.text.unlikely .text.*_unlikely .text.unlikely.*)\n  *(.text.exit .text.exit.*)\n  *(.text.startup .text.startup.*)\n  *(.text.hot .text.hot.*)\n  *(.text .stub .text.* .gnu.linkonce.t.*)\n  /* .gnu.warning sections are handled specially by elf32.em.  */\n  *(.gnu.warning)\n  *(.glue_7t) *(.glue_7) *(.vfp11_veneer) *(.v4_bx)\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This is also the order in which the text section is linked together by the linker. The standard functions generally go in the standard <code>.text</code> section. Therefore, we can put our <code>_startup</code> function before the main <code>.text</code> section by putting it in the <code>.text.startup</code> section. Other than <code>.text.unlikely</code> and <code>text.exit</code> which we won't use, <code>_startup</code> will be the first thing to go into the text segment which is where execution will start at <code>0x8000</code></p> <p>Then, we're in C for initialising the bss section by running the <code>cstartup</code> function:</p>"},{"location":"open-software/raspberry-pi/bare-metal-programming-in-c-part-2/#armc-08-cstartupc","title":"armc-08-cstartup.c","text":"<pre><code>extern int __bss_start__;\nextern int __bss_end__;\nextern void kernel_main( unsigned int r0, unsigned int r1, unsigned int atags );\nvoid _cstartup( unsigned int r0, unsigned int r1, unsigned int r2 )\n{\n/*__bss_start__ and __bss_end__ are defined in the linker script */\nint* bss = &amp;__bss_start__;\nint* bss_end = &amp;__bss_end__;\n/*\n        Clear the BSS section\n        See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.bss for further information on the\n            BSS section\n        See https://sourceware.org/newlib/libc.html#Stubs for further\n            information on the c-library stubs\n    */\nwhile( bss &lt; bss_end )\n*bss++ = 0;\n/* We should never return from main ... */\nkernel_main( r0, r1, r2 );\n/* ... but if we do, safely trap here */\nwhile(1)\n{\n/* EMPTY! */\n}\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Again, not that bad and pretty reasonable.

CMake's documentation is great, so feel free to peruse it whilst reading this tutorial. The tutorial isn't going to cover CMake, other than showing how it can help and some rudimentary stuff which shows how CMake can be setup to do exactly what we were doing in our simple command-line build.</p> <p>CMake generally detects the host information, that is the computer you're compiling on and will assume that the target is the same as the host. However, it's very easy to tell CMake not to use that assumption and instead use a system that we're describing or hinting at. We can hint for example that the target is MinGW when the host is Linux and CMake will setup a lot of settings, knowing that they are useful for targetting Windows. On embedded systems we're describing the system ourself. It's very easy to describe to CMake because it doesn't need to know much. It needs to know what the toolchain filename's are and where they're located.

I think you can read CMake files relatively easily even when you've never seen it before.</p> <p>The toolchain file describes our toolchain. The CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME is essential, and Generic is used by CMake to essentially set the system type to something CMake doesn't yet know about.</p> <p>The <code>CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR</code> is just a string describing the processor type, CMake doesn't use this setting on a system it doesn't know.</p> <p>The <code>TC_PATH</code> (toolchain path) is blank because the toolchain is expected to be in the path. If it's not, then set TC_PATH to something sensible. If you do have to set this - make sure you add a trailing path separator!</p> <p>The <code>CROSS_COMPILE</code> settings is simply the toolchain executable prefix.</p> <p>The <code>CMAKE_C_COMPILER</code> setting is the executable name of the c compiler. It's mainly built up of variables that we set earlier. Normally CMake trys to build a blank test program with the compiler to make sure it's working correctly. However, we need the <code>-nostartfiles</code> flag in order to build something that succeeds and so CMake's test would fail and it would not it would think the compiler was broken.</p> <p>So instead, we add the option <code>CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE</code> which we set to <code>STATIC_LIBRARY</code>. This tells CMake not to try and compile an executable to test the compiler, but instead to just test building a rudimentary static library instead. This should always compile file as we do not need to the C startup code.</p> <p>The <code>CMAKE_OBJCOPY</code> setting looks a bit fancier doesn't it!? CMake knows that <code>CMAKE_C_COMPILER</code> needs to be accessible by the entire project, so it adds it automatically to the CACHE. The CACHE is available to all of the CMake files in the build system. If we set a variable in this toolchain file it only has local scope (meaning only this file can see the value we set to this variable). Therefore we force CMake to add this to the cache. The cache requires a \"type\" for the variable so CMake knows how to use it. In fact most things in CMake are strings. See the documentation for further information on these settings (Look at <code>commands-&gt;set-&gt;CACHE</code> in the documentation).</p> <p>The <code>CMAKE_C_FLAGS</code> settings creates a list of flags that are passed to the compiler when compiling a c source file. Here, we just use the processor-specific flags and again as with OBJCOPY we want to put the <code>CMAKE_C_FLAGS</code> setting from here in the CACHE so that the entire project has this variable. We can add more generic flags like optimisation level to the c flags later on because they're not specific to a particular processor. So, notice that we also have <code>toolchain-arm-none-eabi-rpi1</code> and <code>toolchain-arm-none-eabi-rpi1bp</code> for the other board types.</p> <p>As with autotools, CMake uses a configuration step which works out what should be built and how. The result of the configuration step, if successful, is a Makefile which we can use with make (On Windows you must use <code>mingw32-make</code>) to build our project.</p> <p>CMake uses a file in each directory that needs building called <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>. It's a simple text file as it's extension suggests.

The languages can be left out, and frequently are - but there's a few reasons why we need to tell CMake explicitly what languages we're using here.</p> <p>If we don't do this, CMake tests the C++ compiler to make sure it can compile a simple program to validate the C++ compiler. However, as our system is bare metal and requires specific linker steps this fails and CMake falls over at the first hurdle. CMake assumes that C and C++ are the project's languages if you do not tell it any languages explicitly.</p> <p>Assembler files (.S) in the source list are ignored completely by CMake unless we \"enable\" the assembler by telling CMake in the project definition that we're using assembly files. When we enable assembler, CMake detects gcc as the assembler rather than as - this is good for us because we then only need one set of compilation flags.</p> <p>As we'll see in a bit, to successfully configure, we need to pass some C flags to CMake when configuring. This is so that the C compiler sanity check passes by enabling the C compiler to successfully compile a small C program.</p> <p>We then set the C flags that CMake will use when compiling C ( and assembler! ) files. These are exactly the same as we were passing to the gcc invocation in our bat or sh file to compile.</p> <p>We set the linker flags for when CMake links an executable. Again, this is the same as we were passing to the Linker through gcc when compiling and linking in one command. So CMake will pass this setting to the linker which will make sure we're using our linker script.</p> <p>Then we add an executable target. A target in CMake is basically something to build. An executable means that CMake knows this target is an executable. If we don't apply any special settings to the executable, the target name becomes the output filename for the target, plus any default prefix or suffix (for example Windows executables have the .exe suffix added). After the target name, we simply list the source files (including header files so that CMake can work out the dependencies for the build process).</p> <p>Finally we add a custom command associated with the executable target we've just defined. We declare it as being required to be run after building the executable target. This uses objcopy from our toolchain file to extract the binary image from the ELF file to a kernel image.</p>"},{"location":"open-software/raspberry-pi/bare-metal-programming-in-c-part-3/#building","title":"Building","text":"<p>So now building the example is slightly different. Navigate into the build sub-directory of the tutorial and run the batch file or bash script called configure. You can look in the script file to see how the configure call is done with CMake. The result of this configure command will be a CodeBlocks project file that you can use to edit, and build the tutorial, and there's a Makefile which the CodeBlocks project uses. You can use this Makefile directly to build the tutorial.</p> <p>From now on, when I use the term ${MAKE} I mean on Linux use the make command, and on Windows use the <code>mingw32-make</code> command. If you've not got mingw32-make on Windows then you best go get it now.

We've so far used the GPIO controller to turn an LED on and off, we'll keep that going, but the rate at which we've been turning it on and off is unknown to us. We've just used a volatile loop so the processor takes some amount of time to do the work we've requested (loop and increment a variable!) and then it changes the state of the LED. It'd be much better if we could request that the processor pause for a certain amount of time that is easy to determine in software.</p> <p>The Raspberry-Pi processor (both BCM2835/6) has a peripheral called the System Clock. It's a 64-bit counter that continuously runs at a fixed rate. It's the introduction of this timer in ARM cores that made porting operating systems (which all need to be time-aware for thread context switching, etc.) easy!! Previously porting an operating system to a new processor, even in the same family of parts could require considerable re-writes.</p> <p>Again, referring to the BCM2835-ARM-Peripherals.pdf , on page 172 is the System Timer peripheral. This is a free-running 64-bit counter as we've already seen.</p> <p>We need to access these registers, and of the whole peripheral all we have to do is keep an eye on the counter value as it increases. Each increment takes 1us, so keeping track of time using the System Timer is very easy. In C, we can write a \"driver\" for this peripheral very easily for this basic functionality. We don't even have to initialise the peripheral.</p> <p>Firstly, we'll need the base address of the system timer:</p> <pre><code>#define RPI_SYSTIMER_BASE       0x20003000\n</code></pre> <p>Remember from Pt1 of the tutorial that the physical address <code>0x7E000000</code> is mapped to the ARM physical address <code>0x2000000</code>, so <code>0x7E003000</code> becomes <code>0x20003000</code> to the processor!</p> <p>Then we can generate a struct which is structured the same as the registers for the peripheral:</p> <pre><code>typedef struct {\nvolatile uint32_t control_status;\nvolatile uint32_t counter_lo;\nvolatile uint32_t counter_hi;\nvolatile uint32_t compare0;\nvolatile uint32_t compare1;\nvolatile uint32_t compare2;\nvolatile uint32_t compare3;\n} rpi_sys_timer_t;\n</code></pre> <p>In the driver code, we can declare this type of structure at memory address <code>RPI_SYSTIMER_BASE</code> by using a variable:</p> <pre><code>static rpi_sys_timer_t* rpiSystemTimer = (rpi_sys_timer_t*)RPI_SYSTIMER_BASE;\n</code></pre> <p>and then finally, we can implement our delay function:</p> <pre><code>void RPI_WaitMicroSeconds( uint32_t us )\n{\nvolatile uint32_t ts = rpiSystemTimer-&gt;counter_lo;\nwhile( ( rpiSystemTimer-&gt;counter_lo - ts ) &lt; us )\n{\n// BLANK\n}\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Here, all we do is get the current value of the counter wait until the counter is the required number of us higher than when the function was called before returning. As per the Cambridge tutorials, this version ignores the upper 32-bits of the counter. It will take over an hour before the timer increases above 32-bits anyway, so I'm not expecting us to test a blinking LED for that long!</p>"},{"location":"open-software/raspberry-pi/bare-metal-programming-in-c-part-3/#armc-011c","title":"armc-011.c","text":"<pre><code>#include &lt;string.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\n#include \"rpi-gpio.h\"\n#include \"rpi-systimer.h\"\n/** GPIO Register set */\nvolatile unsigned int* gpio = (unsigned int*)GPIO_BASE;\n/** Main function - we'll never return from here */\nvoid kernel_main( unsigned int r0, unsigned int r1, unsigned int atags )\n{\nint loop;\n/* Write 1 to the GPIO init nibble in the Function Select GPIO peripheral register to enable\n       the LED pin an output */\ngpio[LED_GPFSEL] |= ( 1 &lt;&lt; LED_GPFBIT );\n/* Never exit as there is no OS to exit to! */\nwhile(1)\n{\n/* Set the GPIO16 output high ( Turn OK LED off )*/\nLED_OFF();\n/* Wait half a second */\nRPI_WaitMicroSeconds( 500000 );\n/* Set the GPIO16 output low ( Turn OK LED on )*/\nLED_ON();\n/* Wait half a second */\nRPI_WaitMicroSeconds( 500000 );\n}\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Now we have a slightly slower blinking LED where the time is known - 0.5 seconds before toggling the LED.

This pre-defined value will cause code execution to be interrupted and for code execution to run an exception handler put the pre-defined position. At the end of this exception handler control is generally returned to the previously executing code. Exception handlers should be quick and concise as they can occur frequently and obviously take time away from the main code.</p> <p>Interrupt signals are generally created by hardware. The exception we all know, possibly without realising it is the reset signal. If we strobe the reset line the PC is set to 0 and execution starts from this address. Reset is a bit special though, there's no way to return from the reset exception! All other exceptions can be returned from because the previous PC value has been saved.</p> <p>Although I've stated above that when resetting a processor, execution starts at address 0, this is not always correct. For example in many processors that support bootloaders the reset value can be different so that the application code starts at address 0 and the bootloader code starts somewhere else. Upon strobing the reset line execution will start at the reset vector, which can be different to 0. The important thing here is simply the term vector. A vector is a value that will be loaded into the processors PC when a given condition occurs.</p> <p>Each exception type has a vector, and these vectors reside next to each other in memory in what's termed the vector table. See, it's all pretty easy really! The base address of the vector table is 0. Vector tables come in a few varieties, either each vector is simply a value to be loaded into the PC to start execution at a linker-determined position, or else the vector is code that will be executed straight away without any need to do another PC load.</p> <p>For the ARMv6 architecture the vector table is at memory address 0 and is organised like below, from section A2.6 of the ARM Architecture Reference Manual covering ARMv5 and ARMv6. Please note, that on the ARM documentation website all you'll see is a reference to ARMv6-M or ARMv5. ARMv6-M is for the Cortex-M range of processors which are designed to be more heavily embedded than the application processors (The Cortex-A range), so make sure you get the ARMv5 document which also covers the ARMv6 architecture (which is what the ARM1176JZF-S is).</p> <p>For the Raspberry-pi 2 which uses the Cortex A7 processor the same table can be found in the ARMv7 reference manual in section B1.8.1 (Table B1-3). It is essentially the same.</p> Exception Type Mode VE Normal Address High Vector Address Reset Supervisor 0x00 0xFFFF0000 Undefined Instruction Undefined 0x04 0xFFFF0004 Software Interrupt (SWI) Supervisor 0x08 0xFFFF0008 Prefetch Abort Abort 0x0C 0xFFFF000C Data Abort Abort 0x10 0xFFFF0010 IRQ (Interrupt) IRQ 0 0x18 0xFFFF0018 IRQ (Interrupt) IRQ 1 Implementation Defined FIQ (Fast Interrupt) FIQ 0 0x1C 0xFFFF001C FIQ (Fast Interrupt) FIQ 1 Implementation Defined <p>As you can see, as we've been discussing, the reset vector is at address 0. The next vector is for us to deal with an undefined instruction exception, an unlikely scenario, but something we can at least trap and debug at some point. Following that we have the Software Interrupt, Pre-fetch abort, Data Abort, IRQ (Interrupt) and FIQ (Fast Interrupt) exception vectors. The vectors are sequential except between Data Abort and IRQ where there is an 4-byte gap. The note above the table in the document reads:</p> <p>NOTE: The normal vector at address 0x00000014 and the high vector at address 0xFFFF0014 are reserved for future expansion.</p> <p>Vectors are only 4-bytes (one 32-bit instruction) apart. We know therefore the reset vector is simply going to be a branch instruction to the start of our actual code so that the undefined instruction exception can be implemented too. In fact, each of these vectors is simply a branch instruction to a handler somewhere else in memory.</p> <p>The Normal Address is what we're interested in on the Raspberry-Pi. The High Vector Address is selected in hardware, and that hardware doesn't exist, so the vectors reside at the normal addresses. It's useful, as I've said before to have another place to start executing code if we need a different application installed such as another bootloader or something. We can ignore the High Vector Addresses.</p> <p>Then we have the Mode column - this is going to be very important. If we look at the vector table, the mode listed for the reset vector is Supervisor.</p>"},{"location":"open-software/raspberry-pi/bare-metal-programming-in-c-part-4/#processor-modes","title":"Processor Modes","text":"<p>Further back in section A2.2 of the ARM Architecture Reference Manual the documentation covers processors modes. When the processor is reset it is running in Supervisor mode, which is known as a privileged mode. From this operating mode we can write to most of the processors registers and can also change the processors current mode. The only mode that cannot change modes is User - this is designed to execute applications, whereas the privileged modes are meant for operating system tasks.</p> <p>There is basically a mode per exception. As was mentioned previously we start at the reset vector in Supervisor mode, so far all of our code has operating in that single mode. However, when an exception occurs the processor changes mode to the exception-specific mode. The mode can also be changed in software too if necessary.</p> <p>The next section of the Architecture Reference Manual describes the registers available. This is again, another important section. Look at Figure A2-1 (Register Organization) and you'll see something interesting...</p> <p></p> <p>As seen by the small icon and note at the bottom of the table, some of the registers are mode-specific. This can be useful, for example in the Fast Interrupt exception a lot of registers have been replaced by mode-specific registers. This means that we can use these registers without fear of altering the behaviour of code that was operating in User or Supervisor mode before the Fast Interrupt Exception occurred.</p> <p>Normally, the first thing we would need to do in an interrupt handler would be to save the registers we're going to use and the last thing we'd do in an interrupt handler would be to restore those registers values to what they were before the interrupt handler executed. The code like this at the start of a function or interrupt handler is called the prologue and the code at the end of the function or handler is known as the epilogue.</p> <p>The shadow register implementation means that many times there's no need to save and restore registers in a Fast Interrupt service routine.</p>"},{"location":"open-software/raspberry-pi/bare-metal-programming-in-c-part-4/#coding-interrupt-handlers","title":"Coding Interrupt Handlers","text":"<p>Providing interrupt handlers can be a bit tricky. It's generally entirely non-portable and you'll have to read the manual for your toolchain in order to understand how to write them. This generally involves informing the compiler that a function you declare should be used to handle a type of interrupt. The toolchain can them fill the vector table with the necessary information. The vector table is usually present in the linker script which defines the memory layout of the target device. because normally these vectors are read-only.</p> <p>For gcc and ld we can look at the gcc manual on function attributes relating to ARM. https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Function-Attributes.html</p> <p>It reads:</p> <p>Use this attribute on the ARC, ARM, AVR, CR16, ... ports to indicate that the specified function is an interrupt handler. The compiler generates function entry and exit sequences suitable for use in an interrupt handler when this attribute is present.</p> <p>NOTE, for the ARM, you can specify the kind of interrupt to be handled by adding an optional parameter to the interrupt attribute like this: <code>void f () __attribute__ ((interrupt (\"IRQ\")));</code></p> <p>Permissible values for this parameter are: IRQ, FIQ, SWI, ABORT and UNDEF.</p> <p>The parameter options align well with the vector table we got from the manual. Reset is an ABORT type, and everything else has a parameter available.</p> <p>Therefore to write a very basic \"undefined instruction\" handler we can define declare and implement our handler like this:</p> <pre><code>/**\n    @brief The undefined instruction interrupt handler\n    If an undefined instruction is encountered, the CPU will start\n    executing this function. Just trap here as a debug solution.\n*/\nvoid __attribute__((interrupt(\"UNDEF\"))) undefined_instruction_vector(void)\n{\nwhile( 1 )\n{\n/* Do Nothing! */\n}\n}\n</code></pre> <p>While it looks like this is useless code, it is actually pretty useful. We can set a breakpoint on the while(1) and debug whilst looking out for this breakpoint to trip. Usually then we can do some stack unwinding (manually!) to find where the source of the undefined instruction.</p>"},{"location":"open-software/raspberry-pi/bare-metal-programming-in-c-part-4/#coding-vector-tables","title":"Coding Vector Tables","text":"<p>A strange title that, Coding Vector Tables. With many embedded processors there's no coding or runtime setup of vector tables - instead the vector table is defined in the linker script and the toolchain fills in those locations with the address or jump instruction necessary to execute the relevant handler.</p> <p>The Raspberry-Pi vector table is extremely small, and it can be like this because some extra work is required in the Interrupt handler compared to more embedded processors such as the Cortex M range. No matter what the Interrupt source is, the same function is called. Inside the Interrupt handler we must work out what the source of the interrupt was before handling that interrupt. Essentially you end up with a large switch structure inside the interrupt handler. You can of course call other functions from the interrupt handler, but again think about the cost of the prologue and epilogue before you do!</p> <p>When the raspberry-pi starts running our code, as we've discovered earlier in the turotials it loads the code from the SD card to RAM at address 0x00008000 and then starts executing the code. So how can we possibly code the vector table and get the correct jump instructions into the vector table?</p> <p>Well, everything is in RAM and that's the key - this is read/write memory and in supervisor mode we can write to any location we want. So at runtime when our code is being executed we can overwrite the vector table at runtime. All we need is a vector table to write.</p> <p>Let's have a look at what needs to be done to implement the vector table. It's easiest if we drop down to assembler to do this. It really could do with being done as the very first thing in our code anyway so it's setup right from the start.</p> <p>Here is some modified assembler for our _statup: label which is where our linker knows we want to start execution. The linker makes sure this is at the start of our binary:</p> <p>At fist, I thought this was going to be easy - we just hard-code some values into a table and copy that table to the start of RAM where the vector table resides. Here's some initial code:</p> <pre><code>_start:\n    ldr pc, =_reset_\n    ldr pc, =undefined_instruction_vector\n    ldr pc, =software_interrupt_vector\n    ldr pc, =prefetch_abort_vector\n    ldr pc, =_reset_\n    ldr pc, =_reset_\n    ldr pc, =interrupt_vector\n    ldr pc, =fast_interrupt_vector\n\n_reset_:\n    // Copy the vector table to the active table at 0x00000000\n    ldr     r0, =_start\n    ldr     r1, #0x0000\n    ldmia   r0!,{r2, r3, r4, r5, r6, r7, r8, r9}\n    stmia   r1!,{r2, r3, r4, r5, r6, r7, r8, r9}\n</code></pre> <p>There are only a few assembler instructions here, so don't panic! The labels refer to C functions that have been implemented with the correct attributes for each exception type. See the file <code>rpi-interrupts.c</code> to see these C functions.</p> <p>The Loading of addresses to a register with LDR is documented here</p> <p>reset and undefined_instruction_vector, etc. are the labels used as the function addresses. So we have a table at the very start of our code. A neat side-effect of having this table right at the start of our code is that the first thing we do is run the reset vector code which jumps to the reset label and starts the execution of our code, thus jumping the vector table we don't want it to try and execute. Excellent!</p> <p>The ldmia and stmia instructions can load and store 32 bytes of data at a time, so are quick at shifting data about. Each register can load a 4-byte (32-bit) value, so using eight registers lets us move 32-bytes, and there are 8 32-bit vectors in our table, so one load and one store instruction later we've moved the whole of our vector table to <code>0x00000000</code>.</p> <p>See the documentation for this on the ARM website</p> <p>But, before we go too much further, let me show you why this doesn't work!</p>"},{"location":"open-software/raspberry-pi/bare-metal-programming-in-c-part-4/#its-all-relative","title":"It's all relative","text":"<p>Compilation of the vector table is successful, but as always just a successful compilation doesn't get you a working application.

But of course, it doesn't. The first part of our code now moves the code from 0x8000 to 0x0000 and the constants have not moved from <code>0x806C</code> to <code>0x006C</code>; Neither can we move these constants easily either because the compiler inserts these at the next available space, there's no position we can predict.</p> <p>The answer is to keep everything relative, but to create some constants of our own. We can keep these constants relative to the LDR PC instruction so that the relative offset still works. We need to create a table of constant addresses after the vector table loads. This way we can copy both tables and the constants will still be in the same position relative to the LDR instructions.</p> <p>Let's set that up:</p> <pre><code>_start:\n    ldr pc, _reset_h\n    ldr pc, _undefined_instruction_vector_h\n    ldr pc, _software_interrupt_vector_h\n    ldr pc, _prefetch_abort_vector_h\n    ldr pc, _data_abort_vector_h\n    ldr pc, _unused_handler_h\n    ldr pc, _interrupt_vector_h\n    ldr pc, _fast_interrupt_vector_h\n\n_reset_h:                           .word   _reset_\n_undefined_instruction_vector_h:    .word   undefined_instruction_vector\n_software_interrupt_vector_h:       .word   software_interrupt_vector\n_prefetch_abort_vector_h:           .word   prefetch_abort_vector\n_data_abort_vector_h:               .word   data_abort_vector\n_unused_handler_h:                  .word   _reset_\n_interrupt_vector_h:                .word   interrupt_vector\n_fast_interrupt_vector_h:           .word   fast_interrupt_vector\n\n_reset_:\n\n    mov     r0, #0x8000\n    mov     r1, #0x0000\n    ldmia   r0!,{r2, r3, r4, r5, r6, r7, r8, r9}\n    stmia   r1!,{r2, r3, r4, r5, r6, r7, r8, r9}\n    ldmia   r0!,{r2, r3, r4, r5, r6, r7, r8, r9}\n    stmia   r1!,{r2, r3, r4, r5, r6, r7, r8, r9}\n</code></pre> <p>Note that we've now had to double the amount of data we copy so that we get the constants copied along with the relative PC loads of those constants. This feels like a bit of a cludge but as objdump will show us, this gets the job done and relocates the vector table as required.</p> <p>The vector table now references the labels directly suffixed to the vector table itself and so the relative position remains constant so long as both are copied as-is.</p> <p>The output of <code>objdump -S</code> shows us the workable solution:</p> <pre><code>Disassembly of section .text:\n\n00008000 &lt;_start&gt;:\n    8000:   e59ff018    ldr pc, [pc, #24]   ; 8020 &lt;_reset_h&gt;\n    8004:   e59ff018    ldr pc, [pc, #24]   ; 8024 &lt;_undefined_instruction_vector_h&gt;\n    8008:   e59ff018    ldr pc, [pc, #24]   ; 8028 &lt;_software_interrupt_vector_h&gt;\n    800c:   e59ff018    ldr pc, [pc, #24]   ; 802c &lt;_prefetch_abort_vector_h&gt;\n    8010:   e59ff018    ldr pc, [pc, #24]   ; 8030 &lt;_data_abort_vector_h&gt;\n    8014:   e59ff018    ldr pc, [pc, #24]   ; 8034 &lt;_unused_handler_h&gt;\n    8018:   e59ff018    ldr pc, [pc, #24]   ; 8038 &lt;_interrupt_vector_h&gt;\n    801c:   e59ff018    ldr pc, [pc, #24]   ; 803c &lt;_fast_interrupt_vector_h&gt;\n\n00008020 &lt;_reset_h&gt;:\n    8020:   00008040    .word   0x00008040\n\n00008024 &lt;_undefined_instruction_vector_h&gt;:\n    8024:   000085f8    .word   0x000085f8\n\n00008028 &lt;_software_interrupt_vector_h&gt;:\n    8028:   00008604    .word   0x00008604\n\n0000802c &lt;_prefetch_abort_vector_h&gt;:\n    802c:   00008610    .word   0x00008610\n\n00008030 &lt;_data_abort_vector_h&gt;:\n    8030:   00008624    .word   0x00008624\n\n00008034 &lt;_unused_handler_h&gt;:\n    8034:   00008040    .word   0x00008040\n\n00008038 &lt;_interrupt_vector_h&gt;:\n    8038:   00008638    .word   0x00008638\n\n0000803c &lt;_fast_interrupt_vector_h&gt;:\n    803c:   000086ac    .word   0x000086ac\n\n00008040 &lt;_reset_&gt;:\n    8040:   e3a00902    mov r0, #32768  ; 0x8000\n</code></pre> <p>You can go ahead and see that the armc-013 tutorial is in fact using this solution to provide the exception vector table at run time.</p>"},{"location":"open-software/raspberry-pi/bare-metal-programming-in-c-part-4/#the-interrupt-controller","title":"The Interrupt Controller","text":"<p>So now we have the exception vectors tied to our exception handlers (which are implemented in C) but the processor still doesn't know when to interrupt.</p> <p>Interrupts on a processor are enabled per interrupt source and then globally enabled and disabled.

However, don't forget that the ARM and GPU also share the memory space, and so although we have to communicate through the mailbox, this is what negotiates settings and a framebuffer. The framebuffer address in memory is then returned from the GPU and we can go ahead and write to the framebuffer to see graphics.</p> <p>A framebuffer is a term that really refers to a block of video memory. This video memory is used to display pixels on the screen. So we have access to each pixel on the screen and can change it's colour properties. The framebuffer should be at least as big as the screen resolution. The size of the framebuffer memory block is given by a simple equation:</p> <pre><code>framebuffer_bytes = pixels_x * pixels_y * bytes_per_pixel\n</code></pre> <p>NOTE In this tutorial we'll be using a framebuffer and so won't have any higher-level functions like OpenGL or accelerated graphics. We're going to create a simple software renderer.</p> <p>The number of bytes per pixel sets the number of colours available. The Raspberry-Pi GPU supports 8-bit, but in this mode the 8-bit value corresponds to a palette entry, and the palette appears to be very limited. A palette mode can be really useful as it's fast (minimal amount of memory required for the graphics) and can be really useful for some special effects by simply altering the palette. These were great techniques for fast graphics on the old 16-bit machines in the 1990s.</p> <p>16-bit requires two bytes of data per pixel and directly represents the Red, Green and Blue levels of the colour of the pixel (awkwardly packed into 16-bits), and 32-bit has 4 bytes of data per pixel which has 8-bit per primary colour and an 8-bit alpha channel (transparency).</p> <p>The GPU inner workings are generally quite a closely guarded secret. It's a specialised processor, but also a powerful processor and most people would like to run code on it, just like we're running code on the GPU itself, but alas the GPU information is still under NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) terms.</p> <p>Broadcom however, did release some information and some of the most interesting information is in the BCM21553 Graphics Driver . I'll reference what material I've got from there as we go. Unfortunately there is no definitive source of information for the Raspberry Pi GPU, only bits and pieces scattered around the web.</p> <p>The GPU is a Videocore IV. As we're going to use the mailbox communication with the GPU anyway, we can skip a lot of the GPU detail and just concentrate on communicating with the GPU to get a framebuffer to use.</p> <p>The mailbox interface is our main entry point into the world of graphics. The interface was developed and created by a few guys at broadcom. The mailbox interface is software running on the GPU which receives messages from software running on the arm and returns responses to each message after performing a task. It's implemented in the start.elf file that we require on the SD Card to boot the Raspberry-Pi. You can see their discussion about implementing the mailbox on Github</p> <p>The mailboxes are defined on Github.</p> <p>The interface we're interested in is the Property Interface Mailbox</p> <p>This mailbox is responsible for negotiating the framebuffer.

Firstly, as an aid to debugging now the code is getting more complex it introduces the mini UART which means we can have a basic \"console\". As we've bothered with the standard c library we can see how to tie the standard library functions like <code>printf()</code> to the UART. Secondly, it introduces the mailbox property interface which is a method of the ARM processor talking to the GPU. If we're going to get to the point of generating graphics, we must talk to the GPU!</p> <p>This code does generate an \"animated\" display, but as we'll see - it is extremely slow to use un-optimised software rendering on an RPI! If you want, go ahead and compile it now and plug the raspberry pi into a monitor or television with a HDMI interface. It should work!</p> <p>As we're now including new hardware into the mix it's possible that your monitor or TV doesn't support the resolution and colour depth that the example is hard coded to use. It's an example that's designed to be simple rather than supporting every HDMI panel out there. Hopefully you'll have luck with it. I'm using an old Hanns-G HUD19 monitor with DVI-&gt;HDMI adaptor.</p> <p>If it works, you'll see an ever-changing display which moves through the colour spectrum, continuously writing to every pixel in the framebuffer! You can see the (rather boring) output on YouTube.</p> <p>This tutorial shows how a 700MHz (or 900MHz) processor doesn't give you carte-blanche to program in C and end up with an optimised output.

You should be getting familiar with the layout of these \"driver\" files and the documentation in the BCM2835 peripherals document.</p> <p>We provide an initialisation function so we can set the number of bits (data bits) and the baud rate. The mini UART implementation isn't that configurable because it's not a full UART implementation. It's designed to provide a quick means of providing a console with as little code as possible. So there's no setting for parity or number of stop bits. It's always N1 (No parity, one stop bit).</p> <p>HACK: The calculation for the baud rate registers is done based on a defined system frequency relative to the RPI type. It works, but it's not as nice as using a programatically detected system frequency.</p> <p>The functions are written in a blocking mode, so the write function blocks until the UART can accept the next character, then it writes the new character and returns. Normally we'd use the UART interrupt to send a whole buffer of data rather than manually polling the register as this ties the processor up waiting.

We only need to use mailbox 0. Mailbox has a number of channels to communicate on which are defined in the <code>enum mailbox0_channel_t</code>.</p> <p>The basics of the mailbox operation are pretty straight forward.</p> <p>To write to a mailbox we first construct a composite value. We can write a 32-bit value to the GPU which is generally a memory address, but the mailbox also has to support multiple channels and there is no separate place to write the channel number. In order to achieve multiple channels on a single mailbox the lower nibble (4-bits) are reserved for the channel number and the upper 28-bits are the value we're sending to the GPU. This means that any address we send to the GPU is missing the lowest 4-bits and the GPU simply assumes those bits are all 0. We therefore need to align any address we send the GPU to a 16-byte boundary which will ensure the lower 4-bits will be 0.</p> <p>The ARM waits for the mailbox to become empty by polling the status register and then it can write the composite value of the address and channel to the mailbox.</p> <p>To read from a mailbox we wait until the mailbox is full and read the value. Only when the value contains the same channel as we are waiting to communicate with do we proceed and return.</p> <p>The value is a 16-byte aligned memory address. It's important to know that we don't just send a value and get a value back. We send an address to a memory block that we have constructed specifically formatted messages in to communicate with the GPU. The messages that are passed to the GPU are channel dependant and so aren't defined in this code module. We will do a code module for each channel we use. Actually, we're only going to use one - <code>MB0_TAGS_ARM_TO_VC</code> which is used with the mailbox property interface.</p> <p>NOTE: Although the Framebuffer channel looks like the place to begin, actually we'll ignore that mailbox channel because it's a deprecated channel.

We use a gcc extension to align it to a 16-byte boundary:</p> <pre><code>static int pt[8192] __attribute__((aligned(16)));\n</code></pre> <p>The rest of the functions form a C API to the Mailbox Property Interface. There are various APIs people come up with to generate the memory structure.</p> <p>The messages are constructed such that the data length is large enough for whichever is larger, the message request data size or the response data size. It's also good to note that so long as the data size is large enough the GPU will be happy. i.e. you can use a larger data size for the tag and the GPU won't complain. As you can see from the <code>void RPI_PropertyAddTag( rpi_mailbox_tag_t tag, ... )</code> switch <code>tag</code> statement there are only a few types of tag layout anyway.</p> <p>The GPU acts upon tag values which have the request/response code set to process request settings (always 0). When the GPU has parsed a value and filled the tag's value buffer with the value required it sets the request/response indicator to 1 to show that the data in the value buffer is the GPU's response. All of this modifies the data in-place.</p> <p>The API I wrote for this tutorial allows us to have a simple paradime for using the property interface.</p> <pre><code>/* Initialise, Add and Process tags */\nRPI_PropertyInit();\nRPI_PropertyAddTag( TAG_*, ... );\nRPI_PropertyAddTag( TAG_*, ... );\nRPI_PropertyAddTag( TAG_*, ... );\nRPI_PropertyProcess();\n/* Get the value for each tag */\nproperty_value_buffer = RPI_PropertyGet( TAG_* );\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"open-software/raspberry-pi/bare-metal-programming-in-c-part-5/#the-framebuffer-properties","title":"The Framebuffer Properties","text":"<p>If you don't yet know, a framebuffer is a block of memory who's data is written to a display. The data organisation depends on the display's attributes such as width, height, colour depth, etc. There is not usually a conversion between one type of data and the framebuffer. The GPU simply clocks the data in the framebuffer to the display.</p> <p>If a monitor is plugged in to the Raspberry-Pi the GPU detects it and displays a colour gradiant square on the screen. This shows that the RPI is up and running and has detected the screen.</p> <p>Through the mailbox property interface we can negotiate with the GPU so that it creates a framebuffer in memory that is of the correct size to represent the screen attached (or the size of the virtual screen we've requested). It will return a pointer to that memory so that the ARM has memory it can write to that will be directly written to the screen by the GPU. It's the most basic and simplest form of graphics. Each pixel's colour can be controlled by writing data into the buffer.</p> <p>Let's look at how we use the property interface to negotiate a 32-bit framebuffer at 1280x1024:</p> <pre><code>/* Initialise a framebuffer... */\nRPI_PropertyInit();\nRPI_PropertyAddTag( TAG_ALLOCATE_BUFFER );\nRPI_PropertyAddTag( TAG_SET_PHYSICAL_SIZE, 1280, 1024 );\nRPI_PropertyAddTag( TAG_SET_VIRTUAL_SIZE, 1280, 2048 );\nRPI_PropertyAddTag( TAG_SET_DEPTH, 32 );\nRPI_PropertyAddTag( TAG_GET_PITCH );\nRPI_PropertyAddTag( TAG_GET_PHYSICAL_SIZE );\nRPI_PropertyAddTag( TAG_GET_DEPTH );\nRPI_PropertyProcess();\n</code></pre> <p>As you can see, we set up a load of tags for the GPU to process. We ask it to allocate a framebuffer, so set the physical and virtual size of the screen, and the colour depth. We then also ask it to return us some information, the current pitch, the physical size and the colour depth.</p> <p>The mailbox interface guarantees that the SET_* tags will be completed before the GET_* tags are processed so we can do a single process with all of the tags in place. Some of the SET_* tags may not be able to achieve what we ask for and so we must use the GET_* tags to know what the framebuffer settings actually are.</p> <p>The reason there is a physical and virtual size (and why they are set differently!) is because the virtual size can be larger than the physical size where the physical is \"mapped\" to a part of the framebuffer. The framebuffer is made to hold the largest of the two (which is invariably the virtual size).</p> <p>In the code I've made the virtual size twice the height of the physical size. There are other mailbox properties that allow us to set an offset where the physical screen will begin in the framebuffer. You can think of the virtual as being the framebuffer and the physical as the screen. We can draw to a larger framebuffer in a region that's off the physical screen and then offset the physical screen to the area of the framebuffer we've drawn to and the update to the screen is instant rather than updating as we draw which usually shows artifacts.</p> <p>For now, we just initialise the framebuffer (using the code above) and then write to the framebuffer space within the limits of the physical size. We draw a colour gradient box like the GPU does on power-on, but we \"animate\" it by continuously altering the colour vectors and re-drawing the screen. We use 100% of the CPU processing time to draw and you'll see just how slow this is!</p> <p>Go ahead and run the example. You can spend some time changing the colour depth setting and screen size to see the performance of the framebuffer fill. You'll notice it's a lot slower than you'd realise to refresh the screen when every pixel is written to.</p> <p>This is the code that does the actual draw to the framebuffer:</p> <pre><code>/* Produce a colour spread across the screen */\nfor( int y = 0; y &lt; height; y++ )\n{\nint line_offset = y * width;\nfor( int x = 0; x &lt; width; x++ )\n{\nfb[line_offset + x] = pixel_value++;\n}\n}\n</code></pre> <p>We've stuck with 32 bits per pixel (previously this tutorial had an option). This simplifies the framebuffer drawing and we can see here what we're doing is really simple. All we're interested in is how fast we can write to the screen when modifying every pixel.</p> <p>The pixel offset calculation can be done based on the bpp (bits-per-pixel) or colour depth setting and the number of pixels per line. We're using the width and calculating the start of the next line based on the exact memory size taken up by the pixel data.</p> <p>This isn't entirely right however, because the GPU can choose to optimise the number of bytes per pixel row. The GPU refers to this as the pitch and is returned through the property interface. We should really use that when we move to an option for lower bits per pixel.</p> <p>The framebuffer memory is organised with the top left pixel being at offset 0, in screen coordinates this is <code>0,0</code>. Bottom right is coordinate <code>width-1,height-1</code>.</p>"},{"location":"open-software/raspberry-pi/bare-metal-programming-in-c-part-5/#part-5armc-014","title":"part-5/armc-014","text":"<p>This example expands on the previous part-4 interrupts code and introduces the mailbox API to negotiate a framebuffer with the GPU.

I loved the results. Everything was written in assembler and the tricks and cheats you used were really clever. It was a competitive environment - the moment you saw someone show a demo with something you hadn't coded you just had to get it done. It was hard!</p> <p>With the RPi we have a lot of hardware in front of us - it must be possible to do some rudimentary (and ineffecient) effects.</p> <p>Let's have a go:</p> <p></p> <p>I had this stuff lying around for quite some time before I included it in the turotial, but it moves things in a better direction - a more fun direction. I grabbed a an old demoscene style font as a GIF and use that to do actually display some graphics on the screen.</p> <p>Use GIMP to save a (non-animated) GIF as a c source code. Go and find some other fonts to play with. Although this is a demoscene style font, we'll need a font to generate a console for our RPi in the upcoming tutorials, so it's worth playing around with this stuff.</p> <p>The c soruce from gimp needs to be modified slightly as we need access to the struct from outside of the c file. We <code>typedef</code> the struct in our own header file <code>gimp-image.h</code>. It's all that header does.</p> <p>The c source containing the image data contains 16-bit data. This 16-bit data is the same as the graphics memory in the GPU when we get a 16-bit framebuffer.</p> <p>Loading and displaying images is great for working out how the graphics works at a lower level. The things we have to pay particular attention to are the number of bits per pixel for both the image data and the screen. They must match, or be transposed to match each other some how. We do this by transforming the image data to make it match that of the current dislay. This also includes getting the byte order correct so we know that the colour will be correct when it's displayed on the screen.</p> <p>I've probably not been as thorough as I should be with the graphics in this tutorial code. I know that it works on my monitor with the GIF data in the tutorial though.</p> <p>The code is starting to get messy - we'll need a tidy up in the next tutorial.</p> <p>We have a <code>PutPixel</code> function now, a vertical blit (<code>RPI_BlitV</code>) and we also have some other functions too. We also have a standard Blit (<code>RPI_Blit</code>) function which are simply memory copies from the image data memory space to the video graphics memory space. I've not introduced surfaces, so we've really just got image data and the gpu data in the same format to make things as simple as possible.</p> <p>NOTE: The only supported format at the moment is a 16-bit colour framebuffer. It's enough to get us going, but doesn't have alpha transparency.</p> <p>In modern GPUs, we would load this font/image data up to the graphics card and the GPU would take care of blitting for us. Unfortunately we have to suffer \"software rendering\" which is obscenely slow in comparison. Of course, only for now - until we get some hardware acceleration going!</p> <p>We don't have any hardware acceleration and we only have one thread (we have no context switching yet, and the other processors are parked). So this is all pretty inefficient.</p> <p>There's no vertical sync interrupt that I've found. Instead, I've implemented delta timing in order to stick to a 50Hz refresh rate on the graphics (your mileage may vary here) so it's as flicker-free as possible.</p> <p>Here's the code I've introduced (at a high level):</p> <pre><code>/* Wait 500ms to let UART to settle before we use it. The UART takes a little time to switch\n   speeds. Comment out this to see some garbage at the start of the UART output if you like */\nRPI_WaitMicroSeconds( 500000 );\n</code></pre> <p>Turns out, after we switch the baud rate of the mini uart, we need to wait a certain amount of time before using the uart as it takes a while for the baud rate change to take effect. I'm sure the wait time is more like 10-50 cycles, but it doesn't harm to wait \"enough\" time.</p> <pre><code>font_image = image16_from_gimp( &amp;font09 );\nfont = font_from_image( 29, 35, font_image, 0 );\n</code></pre> <p>We \"normalise\" the font image (which we exported from GIMP) to a 16-bit internal image struct. In this case, the conversion is almost straight-through. But it's important when we've got a framebuffer to normalise all image data to the same data layout as the graphics memory. This way we can \"Blit\", or simply copy chunks of memory into video memory to instantly show graphics.</p> <p>We also do the same for the font when we've normalised the graphical data. Now we have graphical objects representing letters so we can write text to the framebuffer.</p> <pre><code>sinewave_effect_t* text_fx = FX_NewSine((sinewave_settings_t){\n.amplitude = 45,\n.frequency = 1,\n.speed = 4,\n.fb = RPI_GetFramebuffer() });\n</code></pre> <p>I introduced a very basic effects system that is based around sinewaves. They produce the finest effects. Here, under the hood we create a sinewave lookup table which has various attributes.</p> <p>The framebuffer is passed in to the effects generation in order to apply units to the frequency attribute. The width of the screen is set to 1Hz. Therefore if you have, here a frequency of 1Hz will generate 1 full sinewave across the width of the screen.</p> <p>Let's have a closer look, because this stuff represents the biggest changes in the code. Not rpi-specific, but it's important anyway.</p> <pre><code>sinewave_effect_t* FX_NewSine( sinewave_settings_t settings )\n{\nsinewave_effect_t* fx = malloc( sizeof(sinewave_effect_t) );\nfx-&gt;effect.effect_type = TEXT_EFFECT_SINEWAVE;\nfx-&gt;effect.vertical_blit_y_processor = sin_vertical_blit_y_processor;\nfx-&gt;index = 0;\nfx-&gt;settings.amplitude = settings.amplitude;\nfx-&gt;settings.fb = settings.fb;\nfx-&gt;settings.frequency = settings.frequency;\nfx-&gt;settings.speed = settings.speed;\nfx-&gt;sinewave = SIN_New( settings.amplitude, settings.frequency, settings.fb );\nreturn fx;\n}\nsinewave_t* SIN_New( int amplitude, int frequency, framebuffer_info_t* fb )\n{\nsinewave_t* newsine = malloc( sizeof(sinewave_t) );\nnewsine-&gt;amplitude = amplitude;\nnewsine-&gt;steps = (fb) ? fb-&gt;physical_width : 360;\nnewsine-&gt;data = malloc( sizeof(int) * newsine-&gt;steps );\ndouble delta = (double)360 / ( newsine-&gt;steps / frequency );\ndouble deg = 0;\nfor( int step = 0; step &lt; newsine-&gt;steps; step++ )\n{\n/* Convert degrees to radians before sin function */\nnewsine-&gt;data[step] = sin(deg * 0.0174533 ) * amplitude;\ndeg += delta;\n}\nreturn newsine;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Here, we generate a sinewave at a set amplitude and number of steps (relative to the screen width) with a frequency of our choosing.</p> <p>We use a common effects structure with an ENUM that identifies the type of effect in case in future if we develop more effects we need to determine some logical conditions based on the effect type.</p> <pre><code>    fx-&gt;effect.vertical_blit_y_processor = sin_vertical_blit_y_processor;\n</code></pre> <p>Here, we set a function against a graphical event.</p> <pre><code>static int sin_vertical_blit_y_processor(int x, sinewave_effect_t* fx)\n{\nreturn fx-&gt;sinewave-&gt;data[( x + fx-&gt;index ) % fx-&gt;sinewave-&gt;steps];\n}\n</code></pre> <p>In this function, which will get run for every x-pixel position on a supporting graphical function, we return a value from the sinewave data. The vertical blitter was written to support this functionality because normally we can just use memcpy with the front graphical data to move it quickly to video memory to display it.</p> <pre><code>for( int px = 0; px &lt; font-&gt;pixel_width; px++ )\n{\nint py = ( effect &amp;&amp; effect-&gt;vertical_blit_y_processor ) ? effect-&gt;vertical_blit_y_processor(x + px, effect) : 0;\nRPI_BlitV(x + px, y + py, &amp;font-&gt;image-&gt;pixel_data[blit_addr + ( px &lt;&lt; 1 )], font-&gt;pixel_height, font-&gt;image-&gt;pitch );\n}\n</code></pre> <p>In the <code>font_putc()</code> function that's responsible for putting this on the screen we make the function effect-aware. For each column of pixels in each character we run the <code>veritcal_blit_y_processor</code> handler if it is set and apply the effect to the y value of the pixel column.</p> <p>Remember we set the frequency and amplitude of the sinewave? This determines the curvature of the text on-screen. As things stand here, the sinewave effect is static. If the text doesn't move in the horizontal direction the text will simply stay in the same shape every frame.</p> <p>In order to animate the effect we need a new method.</p> <pre><code>void FX_AnimateSine( sinewave_effect_t* fx )\n{\nif( fx == NULL )\nreturn;\nfx-&gt;index += fx-&gt;settings.speed;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>et, voila. This is why we have speed and an index. We can shift the reference between pixel offset and sinewave step. This moves the sinewave effect across the screen. We move the same amount every frame.</p> <p>To show off the effects we also set up another sinewave and apply it to the text position which moves the effected text around the screen centre.</p>"},{"location":"open-software/raspberry-pi/bare-metal-programming-in-c-part-5/#starfield","title":"Starfield","text":"<p>The starfield implementation is a bit crude, but works.

This state object must only be altered through the react framework's <code>setState</code> function. This is so that rendering changes, which are required to happen on the server-side are does as efficiently as possible. If the render function makes use of state then the class knows that it needs to re-render itself and update the component's view.</p> <p>We have added in some event handling for this component. This nicely wraps up a HTML view object and it's related JavaScript support.</p> <p>All the callbacks do are change the scale of the SVG image when the mouse hovers. We could of course do this much more simply in pure CSS, but we're here to investigate how Bulma and React work and how they can work together. I'm very much learning as I go.</p> <p>The <code>render</code> function of the class returns the view. It makes use of the component's state. Using the state doesn't need to be wrapped in a get function, but setting the state must as we've already established be wrapped with the <code>setState</code> function.</p> <p>We can investigate that further later on. We simply return a single image element. Normally we'd wrap the contents returned in a container div. I just wanted the minimum possible here for now. From the render method, we must only have one outer element. Thus, if we want to return an image and a paragraph, that's fine - but both must be wrapped in a div or similar element as a container.</p> <p>If you're familiar with JavaScript then you'll be familiar with the <code>bind(this)</code> construct that's going on here. It's a little laborious, but it must be done for the event handlers to be bound to the class object and therefore be able to make use of <code>this</code> to reference the class object. Without these bind calls, the event handlers would have no knowledge of the class in which they're defined.</p> <p>When you run this commit, we get something like this:</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"random/","title":"Random Stuff","text":"<p>These articles are random and don't really belong anywhere.</p> <p>Mortgage monthly payment calculations</p>"},{"location":"random/mortgage/","title":"Mortgage","text":"<p>How mortgage repayments ( amortization ) works:</p> <p>The math behind remortgage payments is simple, though few people give you it! It's worth looking at to decide how long to take your mortgage over so you can see how a shorter mortgage effects your short-term interest repayment.</p> <p>Lets take an example mortgage of \u00a3250,000 and an interest rate of 3% over 25 years (300) initially and see what happens. The mortgage becomes the Loan Balance at the start of the mortgage (LB0), and the interest rate (APR) is i.</p> <p>The interest rate for mortgages is charged as an Annual Percentage Rate (APR). Thus over the course of 12 months in the example we pay 3%. However, it's not as straightforward as saying that in the first year therefore we pay (<code>250,000 * 0.03 =</code>) <code>\u00a37,500</code> in interest as the interest payments are worked out on a monthly basis as 1/12 of the APR of the remaining loan balance (LBn).</p> <p>So the interest payment for any given month is easy to work out based on the current Loan Balance.</p> <p>In order to work out the monthly payment we need to use the following equation:</p> <p></p> <p>Where:</p> <ul> <li>m is our monthly payment</li> <li>p is the interest rate paid per payment</li> <li>L is the principle loan value</li> <li>F is the future value (this will always be zero at the end of a mortgage, so use 0!)</li> <li>\u03b7 is the value 1 - ((1 + p)^300) where 300 is the number of month</li> </ul> <p>Expanding to fit our values we get this to plumb in to our calculator: <code>m = 0.0025 * ( 250,000 - (250,000/(1 - ((1 + 0.0025)^300))))</code></p> <p><code>m</code> becomes <code>\u00a31185</code> as our monthly payment. Hence our first interest payment is <code>250,000 * (0.03 / 12) = \u00a3625</code> and the amount paid off of the Loan Balance is <code>1185 - 625 = \u00a3560</code>. So we start by paying more interest than balance.</p> <p>As the monthly amount we pay stays the same the interest we pay (as an amount, not as a percentage!) decreases and hence the more of the Loan Balance we pay off. So the second interest payment becomes: <code>(250,000 - 560) * (0.03 / 12) = \u00a3623.60</code> and the amount paid of the Loan Balance is <code>1185 - 623.60 = \u00a3561.40.</code></p> <p>For more information on the maths behind amortization, look at the University of Utah's website</p> <p>Having proved the maths we can move onto someone\u00a0else's\u00a0calculator to do the hard work for us and plumb in the parameters to see how the mortgage repayment is affected. The first thing to do is to make sure the site's calculator agrees with our own calculation.</p> <p>Go to the Loan Amortization calculator on easycalulation.com and fill in the values we've used as an example here (Leave the month and year as January of this year) and press calculate. Scroll down to the results and you'll see the monthly payment is \u00a31185.53 with the first payment being made up of \u00a3625 of interest and \u00a3560.53 paid off of the Loan Balance. This proves the sites maths is correct, as is ours.</p> <p>Now lets look at how the amount of interest we pay is affected by the length of our loan.</p> <p>Let's fast forward 10 years. Scroll down to January in ten years from the start. We get the following Loan Balance payment and interest payment along with the total left outstanding:</p> 2022 January 756.35 429.18 170914.63 <p>Now change the values in the calculator to take the mortgage out over 15 years instead and look at where we are in 10 years again:</p> 2022 January 1486.25 240.2 94594.99 <p>The values have changed pretty significantly. Importantly the monthly payment has changed from <code>\u00a31185.53</code> to <code>\u00a31726.45</code>, and very interestingly the amount left on the loan remarkably <code>\u00a376,319.64</code> less.</p> <p>We've been paying more in, in-fact we've been paying <code>\u00a3540.92</code> extra per month in over ten years. That's <code>\u00a364,910.40</code> extra we've paid, but we're <code>\u00a376,319.63</code> further into the loan so after 10 years we've saved <code>\u00a311,409.23</code> (of course assuming the rate has not changed)</p> <p>Note the total interest paid over the lifetime of the loan:</p> <p><code>\u00a3250,000 @ 3%</code> over 25 years: <code>\u00a3105659</code></p> <p><code>\u00a3250,000 @ 3%</code> over 15 years: <code>\u00a360761</code></p> <p>That's a saving of <code>\u00a344,898</code> over the course of the mortgage. But you've got to stomach the higher monthly payments. Rates vary and they inevitably will go higher at some point (Currently in the UK there's little room for them to move other than up when the economy gets going again) so a buffer zone is required, although you want to pay off as much as possible as quickly as possible. The longer your loan term, the more interest you pay.</p>"},{"location":"random/mortgage/#interest-only-mortgages","title":"Interest Only Mortgages","text":"<p>So whilst looking at mortgage options, we also have the interest-only mortgage. It gives you a low interest rate and is designed to allow you to put your Loan Balance payments to work in a seperate savings account. The selling feature is that the interested earned through the savings will make you better off in the long run.</p> <p>The interest per payment is always on the outstanding Loan Balance as before, but with the caveat that you do not pay anything off of the Loan Balance each month. The money you put into a separate savings account is entirely seperate to the mortgage. This has repercutions. You cannot directly relate savings percentages (APR) to mortgage percentages here.</p> <p>The Loan Balance is only altered after a certain amount of time and the money in the savings account is placed into the mortgage to reduce the Loan Balance. At this point your interest only payment (essentially your monthly mortgage payment) is reduced because the Loan Balance has decreased and you are now paying a monthly interest payment on a smaller outstanding balance.</p> <p>Lets look a bit closer:</p> <p>On a mortgage of <code>\u00a3150,000 @ 2.75%</code> APR over 15 years the monthly payment at the start of the mortgage is <code>(150,000 * (0.0275 / 12)) = \u00a3343.75</code>. This is a pure interest payment.</p> <p>If we do the maths for a standard mortgage using the calculator over at <code>easycalculation.com</code> we see that the first interest payment is indeed <code>\u00a3343.75</code> and the first prinicple payment (off the Loan Balance) is <code>\u00a3674.18</code>. So we need to be saving <code>\u00a3674.18</code> a month to be on-par with the standard mortgage payment.</p> <p>The term before the Loan Balance is reduced in an interest only mortgage is decided upon when the mortgage is agreed, but 3-4 years appears to be about the norm.</p> <p>So lets look in 4 years time:</p> <ol> <li> <p>For the standard mortgage, the following interest payments have been made:</p> </li> <li> <p>343.75, 342.2, 340.66, 339.1, 337.55, 335.99, 334.43, 332.86, 331.29, 329.72, 328.14, 326.56, 324.97, 323.39, 321.79, 320.2, 318.6, 317, 315.39, 313.78, 312.17, 310.55, 308.93, 307.3, 305.68, 304.04, 302.41, 300.77, 299.12, 297.48, 295.83, 294.17, 292.51, 290.85, 289.18, 287.51, 285.84, 284.16, 282.48, 280.8, 279.11, 277.41, 275.72, 274.02, 272.31, 270.6, 268.89, 267.17</p> </li> </ol> <p>...which is a total interest payment of \u00a314,694.38 over the four years. We've paid off \u00a334,166.37 which gives us a new Loan Balance of \u00a3115,833.63 at the end of the four year period.</p> <ol> <li>For the interest-only mortgage we've been paying the 1/12 of 2.75% of the Loan Balance (LB0) for the entire period (12 * 4 = 48 months) which is a total of \u00a316,500.00 over the four year period.</li> </ol> <p>Assuming that we settle on the same monthly outgoings for mortgage, we've been saving \u00a3674.18 per month into our savings account which has totalled (before interest!) \u00a332,360.64.</p> <p>Working out the interest earned is going to be based on a monthly-interest account figuring a 4.5% interest rate (APR). So each month we earn (4.5/12)% of our current Savings Balance.</p> <p>In a 4.5% interest (APR) account our savings have reached \u00a335,383.55 which means we have earnt a total of \u00a33022.91 interest.</p> <p>Paying this off of our Loan Balance means at the end of this period with the interest only mortgage our new Loan Balance to probably re-mortgage again is \u00a3114,616.45</p> <p>That's good, it's \u00a31217.18 better than through a standard mortgage. However, over the course of four years, we've paid an extra (16500 - 14694.38) \u00a31805.62 in interest. So in effect we're \u00a3588.44 worse off.</p> <p>To conclude on interest-only though, you have a life-buffer which is your mortgage savings. You'll have to ensure that a long term high interest account is available - and I've not allowed for taxed savings (All my savings would be skimmed of 40% by our nice government!). Saving this amount of money is well outside your ISA quota, so don't expect ISA's to cover your saving requirements.</p> <p>Infact, by paying tax on the savings we get a different story:</p> <p>In a 4.5% interest (APR) account with 40% tax on savings our account has reached \u00a334,132.27 which means we have earnt a total of (34132.77 - 32360.64) = \u00a31772.13 interest.</p> <p>Paying that off the loan balance results in a balance of \u00a3115,867.73 after the four year period. That's (115,867.73 - 115,833.63) = \u00a334.1 worse off on the balance, plus we've paid an extra \u00a31805.62 in interest don't forget. So now it doesn't seem great.</p> <p>If you only get three percent on your interest (still subbing 40% for tax) our savings only reach \u00a333,528.04 which is only \u00a31167.4 interest. The resulting Loan Balance is \u00a3116,471.96 which is \u00a3638.33 worse off on the balance and the extra interest paid on the Loan Balance.</p> <p>The key to interest free is early pay-off. That is we decide early on that we can afford more than the bank will let us have. So we take the same \u00a3150,000 mortgage and decide that instead of a monthly payment of \u00a31017.93 each month, we can actually afford \u00a31300 per month instead.</p> <p>This results in a monthly savings payment of \u00a3956.25. Plumbing this into the savings math (and still allowing for 40% tax) we end up with a total of \u00a347,555.82 in the savings account. We've accumulated interest of (\u00a347,555.82 - \u00a345,900) = \u00a31655.82 which pretty much gets rid of the \u00a31805.62 extra interest paid because of the interest being on the starting loan balance every month with this mortgage type.</p> <p>We now have a large difference however our Loan Balance going forward (i.e. to remortgage). The Loan Balance for the increased payments over four years is ( \u00a3150,000 - \u00a347,555.82 ) = \u00a3102,444.18. This is a difference of ( \u00a3115,833.63 - \u00a3102,444.18 ) = \u00a313,389.45! This has cost us (1300 - 1017.93) * 48 = \u00a313,539.36</p> <p>Of course, you can do this with a standard mortgage payment too. Usually you can over-pay into a normal mortgage which is good because the payment immediately reduces the Loan Balance, but most mortgage providers</p> <p>Although this looks like there is no gain, that's wrong. The gain is having a lot of transiently available savings. You'll have large sums of money you can pull on if necessary. Of course ultimately this will lengthen your mortgage repayment, but the flexibility means you can live with a lot less stress than having a high montly payment commitment.</p>"},{"location":"random/mortgage/#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":"<p>So what are the compromises associated with these different ways of mortgaging?</p> <p>Well, simply getting a short-term mortgage means you have to aggressively pay the Loan Balance off and you're trying to minimise the interest you pay. However the effects of the reduced interest are only really seen later on (10yr+) in the mortgage and you must stomach high payments as seen earlier.</p> <p>A longer term mortgage means you'll be paying more in interest payments (but again the positive effect of this is only seen in the latter stages of the mortgage). You'll have moderately high payments to pay and could save alongside the mortgage up to the montly amount you've set aside for the mortgage. This will give you a small buffer should things go a bit Pete Tong. Some of these mortgages will let you over-pay, but that will mean you are effectively living life with no buffer because you've put it into the Loan Balance of the mortgage. You cannot get access to that money once it's been paid, and you'll also likely get an over-payment charge as the mortgage company like to have the regular interest payments.</p> <p>Fixed interest works out about even if you can get a decent savings account (even on taxed savings). Some savings can of-course be put into tax-free savings too, any that are investment-based and free from capital gains tax too. You can then be aggressive with your savings because the actual payment required on a monthly basis is the origianl Loan Balance interest payment which is a low figure. The rest of what you decide is a survivable mortgage outlay can be pumped into the savings account. This means there is a lot of money in easy-access savings accounts.</p> <p>Fixed or variable rate just depends on what the interest rates are going to do and so do not really need to go towards your mortgage type decision.</p>"},{"location":"v6manta/","title":"Index","text":"V6 Opel Manta <p>My V6 Opel Manta has a 2.5ltr Vectra V6 engine, running a DTA S80 ECU and throttle bodies.

2003-07-28","text":"<p>Matt (Animal) Very kindly gave me a set of front shocks that came from his V6 project manta coupe, and a set of 60mm lowering springs for my manta to get me going. It's MUCH better than standard, although with the 185/70R13 tyres, thing still feel a bit wooly! lol I'm not really suprised! We fitted these at VBOA, Billing '03. It ddin't take that long to fit them, but Animal knew all the neat tricks of doing it quickly ;)</p> <p>They certainly make cornering a bit better, even on these outrageous tyres.</p> <p>The harnesses help under cornering loads too. I've just changed the red OMP one for some Black ones. Still a 3-point, and still 2\" webbing. I really need to upgrade to 4-point harnesses and 3\" webbing, it'll be much comfier when pushing the car hard on a track. Even on the road, I notice the 2\" webbing, and I notice that the harness is constantly pulling me to sit slightly differently to how I would like. Maybe I just need to set up these black ones again. The red one was fitted at Billing also, and I really didn't take the time to set that one up, so I knew it would be a bit uncomfortable. Reaching the dash and the door when it's fuilly open isn't a problem though when I'm strapped in. The only thing I can't reach is the manual choke. But I can now operate that with my foot ;) It will be going when my XE engine goes in anyway.</p> <p>Well, I got hold of some of the great revolution wheels that many people use in rallying. They are light, and very strong. Most of their strength comes from the five thick spoke design, but the spokes are also deep in the alloy. The trouble with this is that caliper clearance is reduced for added strength. I have some cosworth calipers already though, that I will be running with some V6 288mm discs, and I have checked that these fit ok. They fit fine under these alloys with no spacers needed.</p> <p>The revolutions are ET35, with a 7\" width. I've had these for a while now, but I've only just got around to putting some tyres on them. For economic reasons ( I'm skint! lol ) I have chosen to put 195/50R15 toyo proxes T1-S all round. Initially I would have preferred to have tried a 45 profile, and gone for 195/45 up front, and 215/45 at the rear, but my bank manager said otherwise! </p> <p>Here they are fitted to the car, they certainly transform the look of the car, as well as the handling</p> <p></p> <p>Now the car has some turn in! lol It really didn't before. I am also glad of the 50 profile, it seems to give a little, but not too much like the 70 profiles exaggerated!</p> <p>On hard cornering the car can be seen to judder the inside rear wheel forwards and backwards! Just showing up how old the suspension bushes are on the car. They are in desperate need of uprating/replaciing. Other than that, the car is a hoot to drive now. Although the engine fan blowing hot air onto my left hand after being at a junction for a little while is getting annoying now! :roll: It's time I blocked the old heater matrix holes in the bulkhead, and mounted all the electrical switches onto something I can reach easily. I am thinking of putting a switch panel on the transmission tunnel by the gearstick. I can reach everything there then when I have the harness on.</p> <p>At the moment, I am really enjoing the car.</p> <p>COST SO FAR </p>"},{"location":"v6manta/2003/2003-07-28-/#list","title":"list \u00a3375 - car \u00a30 - suspension (Thank you Animal :) ) \u00a395 - Quaife Quick rack ( not yet fitted ) \u00a3140 - 195/50 toyos x 4  -  https://www.blackcircles.com  \u00a3100 - Second hand revolution wheels","text":""},{"location":"v6manta/2003/2003-07-28-/#/list:u","title":"/list:u  TOTAL = \u00a3710","text":""},{"location":"v6manta/2003/2003-07-28-brought-a-1.8s-berlinetta/","title":"2003 07 28 brought a 1.8s berlinetta","text":"<p>v6manta</p>"},{"location":"v6manta/2003/2003-07-28-brought-a-1.8s-berlinetta/#2003-07-28-2003-07-28-brought-a-18s-berlinetta","title":"2003-07-28 - 2003-07-28 Brought a 1.8S berlinetta","text":"<p>Animal and I travelled to the sea side in order to pick up this 1987 1.8 berlinetta coupe. I was determined to get a coupe, but mainly only because they look a bit better than the Cavalier looking hatch in my opinion. I hoped for one without a sunroof, but this one appeared at only \u00a3375! Bargain I thought, so we picked it up there and then. </p> <p>Part of the attraction of this car were the following points:</p> <p>(a) It's a 1.8, and this OHC engine shares the same block design as the 2ltr 16V (Family 2) opel engine, so fitting this engine in the future would be very easy, and I would have all the parts I need.</p> <p>(b) White is an easy colour to work with. Looks fine for a rally-like track car ;)</p> <p>\u00a9 It's cheap, and has quite a solid shell.</p> <p>The car was bog standard when I brought it. With some VERY soft and wobbly suspension.. AVO do a nice coilover kit for the manta, so eventually, that's what I have planned for her.</p> <p>I got straight down to business with stripping the interior out of the car in order to reduce the kerb weight. Having removed the passenger seat, and the rear bench seats, as well as all the sound proofing, dash (except the dials) and the heater matrix + fan blower, etc. I have achieved about a 115kG weight loss. This sat the suspension even higher than normal!!    </p> <p>Here are some images from the car getting stripped:</p> <p> The heater matrix + fan / blower and sound deadening is removed for weight saving. Although when driving on a damp day, you do suffer a lot from condensation on the inside of the car  </p> <p> No passenger seat, and no dash. The manta dash is all quite heavy as it is densly moulded foam, with a metal backing. All weight counts in a track car I think, so that all went in the bin. The clocks remain so that the car is still road legal, and I know what speed I'm doing!  </p> <p> The rear bench has also gone, and there is no longer any sound deadening on the floor. The sound deadening can be removed easily with a plastic scaper and a heat gun, or blow torch. When the sound deadening is heating, it becomes a lot more pliable, and the backing glue melts, you can then scrape it easily off the shell. For any flue that remains, I recommend you use a clotch, or scotch cloth if it's really stubborn, and use white spirit to remove the glue. It melts it very easily, and is a lot better than thinners, as it does not evaporate as quickly.  </p> <p> I have relocated the battery to passenger seat (when I install one anyway! :p ) This helps with weight distribution. Having this weight much lower down is beneficial. Every little helps ;)  </p> <p> The gunk that is put on the doors to stop the trim rattling is horrible stuff. But with enough effort, comes off without removing the paint if you use white spirit and a plastic scraper, and a cloth to tidy up with.  </p> <p> It's a fairly old car, and rust is in a few places, but overall this is a good shell, especially what I paid for it! I hammerited the front part of the shell, but this is only a very small part of the job ahead. I intend to take off all the underseal, and replace it with hammerite, or a similar strong white paint. This will enable me to see problem areas with the shell quickly. It will also highlight CV joint grease leakages, and oil leaks from the diff, gearbox or engine easily.  </p> <p> Yep, weight is now harder to get rid of. This little pile consists of some bits of wound deadening from the engine bay, which sits right behind the engine on the bulk head, and the headlamp wiper motors. All in all about 2kG. Not much at all considering the effort involved in removing these bits! But it's really not worth them being on the car either.  </p>"},{"location":"v6manta/2003/2003-07-28-stage-rally-opel-manta/","title":"2003 07 28 stage rally opel manta","text":"<p>v6manta</p>"},{"location":"v6manta/2003/2003-07-28-stage-rally-opel-manta/#2003-07-28-2003-07-28-stage-rally-opel-manta","title":"2003-07-28 - 2003-07-28 Stage Rally Opel Manta","text":""},{"location":"v6manta/2003/2003-07-28-stage-rally-opel-manta/#There was a time when it was on the road!","title":"There was a time when it was on the road!  ..and it looked pretty good too.

The use of a wire brush on an angle grinder makes light work of most of the seam sealer. There's only a few bits I can't get to, and I think another, more pointy brush in a drill will get to those bits. </p> <p>The seam sealer hides all sorts of nasties, and I'd rather just see what is there. Plus if there are seams that I want to seam weld, then Cleaning them up first is essential, and I will be able to spot any stressed or cracked parts easily without the seam sealer hiding it all. Theres quite a lot of seam sealer all over the car though! lol.</p> <p>These are the brakes that I am fitting onto the front of the manta. The rear remains as std drums at the moment.  </p> <p>They are 288mm V6 vented discs, which have been redrilled so that they fit onto the manta hubs. The calipers are from a ford cosworth I believe. I have had to make some brackets to space them out from the centre of the hub a bit, and also to push them further into the wheel so that they sit central on the disc. They seem to fit fine now under the 15\" revolutions, with no other wheel spacers required which is a good bonus.</p> <p>Now this is where my problem lay whilst fitting the brakes, and having a spongey brake pedal leading to 3points on my liscence :(</p> <p> </p> <p>The caliper bolt would not seal the hose onto the caliper, and I think that the manta bolt may have been a bit too long, as I thought I was tightening up the hose to the caliper, all I was doing was putting more strain on the bolt as it had hit the end of the caliper housing. My solution, as I had stripped the thread in the caliper, was to drill out the current thread, and put a new larger thread in. I threaded it with an M12x1.25 thread, and I had a bolt to suit, which I put on the lathe, and the drilling machine, and on the saw! lol to make a brake bolt out of it so that the brake fluid could pass through the centre of it. It worked a treat, and that side bolted up and sealed lovely. Now the other side I did with the original bolt, but I used some 3mm thick copper washers like I had made for the other side. But suprise, suprise, the bloody thing didn't seal again. I have now done both sides with a M12x1.25 thread. I wonder if goodridge or anyone does decent fittings with that thread? probably not knowing my luck! lol </p> <p>I need to get some braided hoses made up really, but I'll leave it for the moment, as I'm just trying to get the manta past an MOT.

A resistor is provided with it so that the diodes, and ECU are protected from the Alternator load dumping. ( This is where the voltage rises from the alternator when it is running, and not attached to the battery. ) Normally the alternator voltage regulator would have a voltage clamp on it, but some don't</p> <p>Battery box. \u00a316.50+VAT As I want the battery situated behind the passenger seat, it needs to be sealed ( well, vented, but essentially sealed ). Mainly to prevent leakage of battery acid in an accident. Dry-gel batteries would not need to be sealed. But I will be using a standard Lead-Acid car battery.</p> <p>So, with those few things on order, I can get on with prepping the shell ( Mainly stich welding the shell, and seam welding the suspension turrets. ) Closing the bulkheads, etc. and with these few bits, the car will be close to being able to see it's first rally.</p> <p>But of course I need an approved helmet, fireproof clothing ( Race suit ), and of course a National B license before I can race the car.</p> <p>The car must undergo scrutineering before it turns up at any event, so soon I'll have to pop along to my local motorsport club and find out who will be doing the scrutineering.

I had finished off the interior painting before Christmas, so everything but the outside of the shell was painted. Now it was time for the exciting part - putting the final colour on.</p> <p>Apprehension was with me in the morning before Lee and I started prepping the car ready for the colour as I have never achieved good results with spraying, but then I've always spraying with cellulose out of a rattle can. I've never sprayed more than a wing before and I'd never touched two-pack before either.</p> <p>Saturday, the car was masked up although it didn't hold that well, I can highly NOT recommend B&amp;amp;Q &amp;quot;Finest&amp;quot; masking tape (the blue type they sell). The shell was then primed with two coats of high build two pack primer. The primer went on pretty well, but as I found out whilst doing the white painting, primer is thicker than paint so it's a lot easier to apply.</p> <p></p> <p>We started again on Sunday fairly early and it was here when the nerves started to emerge - what if it runs everywhere, what if I !*#@ it up, etc., etc.</p> <p>We started off with Lee flatting off the primer with some 500grit wet and dry, and I re-did the a lot of the masking off using standard masking tape from a local motor factors. Then we blew off the dust, wiped over with some panel-wipe and then finally went over it with a few tack cloths.</p> <p>Then came the moment of truth, Lee mixed the paint and we poured it in the pot. Lee set-up the gun to get a good level of paint and a good fan and then started on the first panel to show me how fast to be moving the gun, and also showed me how to plan each panel before squeezing the trigger! After the first panel was done, the apprehension had gone. A bit of the Manta was orange and looked amazing. I couldn't wait to get stuck in on the rest of the shell. Lee handed me the gun and it felt great to spray the colour on whilst Lee guided me along. It was easy to see where you had sprayed on the first coat, orange onto light grey primer was a good contrast.</p> <p>Lee did the first couple of coats of orange on the roof because I found it awkward enough spraying other bits of the shell without needing awkward, hard-to-reach panels to spray too, but he made me get up there and do the final coat.</p> <p>The shell had three good coats of orange, and with every coat the finish just got better as the confidence of how much paint could go on without running built up, and the depth of the orange deepened.</p> <p>The photos are the only things that can show the how well the finish is from the gun, I think the Devilbiss GTi is the best tool I've ever bought and I'm very glad I did. And the number of runs I managed to put in the paint? None!!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>It's safe to say that Lee and I were like children on Christmas morning when we had finished spraying. I was dying to see the orange contrasting the interior. Most of the masking was done from inside, and after the final coat had gone tacky we just had to remove some of the masking to see what it looked like - Stunning!!</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>It's safe to say that without Lee's guidance you would most likely be looking at photo's of an orange floor and white Manta! lol.

The question I need answered is what offsets and widths can I run on the Manta without the wheels fouling the bodywork.</p> <p>A guy at compomotive suggested a 0 offset 8&amp;quot; wheel would fill the rear arches which surprised me, so I decided it's best just to measure it myself rather than trust anyone at face value. I suspect that when I spoke to him, he thought it would have a 400 kit on, even though I had said it was a standard coupe bodyshell. A zero offset 8&amp;quot; rim is not going to fit the rear end well at all.</p> <p>I mounted the axle, and set it straight, in the middle of the rear arches, and fitted a couple of Lee's wheels which are 7&amp;quot; with a high offset (I will check soon to see what offset) to see what interfered, and/or what I could get away with.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The top photo shows plenty of room between the outside arch and the wheel/tyre, and the bottom photo shows that there is plenty of room on the inside edge of the wheel/tyre and the chassis or suspension spring.</p> <p>A couple of problems did arise from this fitting though. I had designed the link arms around the panhard rod, assuming that as standard, the normal road height would be with the panhard rod parallel to the floor - this would make the most sense. However, as can be seen in the top photo, the manta would suit gravel rallying only at this height.</p> <p>The following photo shows how much room there is for the link arms to move before hitting the chassis rails. Not a lot of room. However, the same photo shows that the link arm can be moved down the axle 3-4&amp;quot; which should allow the axle to hit the bump stops without the link arms hitting the chassis.

After looking everywhere for 3M Nextel paint, my dad managed to locate some for me, and a big thanks to him. I tried trimite for a suede effect paint, but they had a minimum order of 5ltrs, which at \u00a335 a litre + hardener + thinners was a bit much for the small amount of painting I needed to do!</p> <p>Many internet searches say that Nextel is no longer made, but that actually translates to 3M no longer manufacturing it. It is however still produced under licence from 3M by a German company called Mankiewicz. 3M originally designed nextel under contract for NASA for the space shuttle to coat their control desks. It is extremely mat and non-reflective which is ideal for the area surrounding the windscreen so I don't get blinded on sunny days.</p> <p></p> <p>3M is a two pack paint, and can be sprayed on. However, they recommend a 1.5-1.8mm tip. I used a 1.4mm tip, because that's what I had and I wanted to get this done ASAP as it was holding me back. It is extremely thick without thinners, and I put in as much thinners as I dared which really was quite a lot, but the gun still struggled. I struggled with it a lot, but in the end, the finish is fine for a rally car; near-black and non-reflective. Matt or Satin finishes from standard aerosol's come nowhere near as matt as nextel. Nextel is also very hard wearing, hence why I did the cage with it too.</p> <p></p> <p>I also did some actual measuring up to find out what tyre widths I need to run.

I need to use a 16&amp;quot; rim to be able get the wheels over the front brakes which will need to be pretty large. I am not using a brake servo and it will be doing tarmac events.</p> <p>Having had a good measure up with a few fabricated bits of steel I worked out that I need to run 225 maximum at the rear, as 245's and 265's don't fit inside the arch no matter what the wheel offset could be.</p> <p>With 225's at the rear, I will use 205's at the front. Kumho recommends an ideal wheel rim width to be 7.0&amp;quot; for each tyre (The front's having a section of 45 and the rears having a section of 50). So at least that means I can run the same wheels all round. I also need to run an offset of 45mm. I measured 40mm, but as there will be a brake disk between the half shaft and the wheel, 45mm seems a good bet.</p> <p>So, I need to get:</p> <p>Kumho V70A, 205/45R16 (Front) Kumho V70A, 225/50R16 (Rear) Braid Winrace 'A', 16x7&amp;quot;/ET45/PCD4x100</p>"},{"location":"v6manta/2008/2008-03-15-front-suspension-build/","title":"2008 03 15 front suspension build","text":"<p>v6manta</p>"},{"location":"v6manta/2008/2008-03-15-front-suspension-build/#2008-03-15-2008-03-15-front-suspension-build","title":"2008-03-15 - 2008-03-15 Front Suspension Build","text":"<p>The front suspension is now built up.

I spent a while rebuilding the selectors and checking that everything worked again. It was quite good to find out exactly what all the other fixings in the box did. Then I moved the gearbox into neutral and fitted both halves back together.</p> <p>With the front half of the box on two bits of wood to let the input shaft protrude when I fitted the gearkit and rear half of the casing, I lowered the rear casing and gearkit into position. It stops short because the selector rods move and do not locate properly in the front casing. Last time I used a mallet to get it all back together, and this is probably why the selector had moved beyond it's normal range. This time I used a set of pliers to gently move the selector rods to get them to locate in the front casing.

This has also meant that I've had to go in a different direction with the gearbox too. I've chosen to go with the Cosworth T5 box which is tough as old boots and has a SCCR gearset available. I'm expecting the bellhousing later on this week, so as soon as I find a gearbox I can start fitting the engine and box into the engine bay.</p> <p>I have also welded on the quick release steering boss onto the corsa column I am using. All I need to do now for the steering column is make the link bar from the column end to the rack and make a nylon bearing for the steering wheel end of the column as I cannot split the standard bearing to fit it back onto the column now that it's been welded.</p> <p></p> <p></p>"},{"location":"v6manta/2008/2008-09-02-rebuilt-oil-pump--started-headwork/","title":"2008 09 02 rebuilt oil pump  started headwork","text":"<p>v6manta</p>"},{"location":"v6manta/2008/2008-09-02-rebuilt-oil-pump--started-headwork/#2008-09-02-2008-09-02-rebuilt-oil-pump-started-headwork","title":"2008-09-02 - 2008-09-02 Rebuilt Oil Pump + Started Headwork","text":"<p>Quite a big update I suppose, which you'd expect considering I haven't updated for a while!</p> <p></p> <p>I stripped and rebuilt the Titan 3-Stage oil pump which will be the basis of my dry-sump system. The pump was a bit notchy. When I took it apart, there were some burs present on the outer-most diameter of the pump rotors. I de-burred them and re-built the pump. When it was back together it felt much better. I spoke to Lee who advised it should be fine so long as the Annulus' were not burred. So, job should be good.</p> <p></p> <p>I powered up the R6 clocks to check I had the right wiring diagram for them. There is a nice out-of-focus photo of them to show what they are like with the back lighting on.</p> <p></p> <p>I have also started the oil and fuel plumbing for the engine. The radiator is fitted in place, I just need to make some clip-mounts for the top of it.  The Dry-Sump tank is positioned, but needs it's bracket welding in place. I'll weld the bracket in place when the engine is mounted with the gearbox, just to make sure! The rad fan and oil cooler are in there too, so things are starting to come together.</p> <p></p> <p>I decided that I should also do some head work to the V6. As I will be running the V6 on throttle bodies it will be very beneficial to do some work on the heads. They are designed for high torque and not so much aimed at ultimate power. In the manta, I can bias towards power as the torque from a tuned V6 is always going to be enough as it's not exactly a heavy car.</p> <p>The standard head design creates a venturi effect as the air passes the injector pintle - this speeding up of gas flow helps cylinder fill at mid-range revs and helps enhances the fuel and air mixture to increase torque. Another advantage I will have is the fact that I am running &amp;quot;Pico&amp;quot; injectors which can run a higher injector pressure and thus atomise the fuel more thoroughly compared to the standard bosch injectors.</p> <p></p> <p>The Standard inlet is not bad, the casting quality is okay; Not amazing, but okay. There are some standard places where gain can be made, and there are also big bonus places to make really good flow improvements. The C25XE inlet port shape is not beneficial to power because of the venturi design I mentioned earlier. It needs to be changed, ideally it should be increased to a circular inlet tract. The flow area at the inlet is only just that of a single inlet valve, ideally we are looking for around xx% of the TOTAL inlet valve area. Sorry, I didn't actually take any photo's of this part of the porting, although if you are porting a V6 head you'll see from the photos later on that the inlet port shape is very different to standard!</p> <p>Part one of porting includes starting to knife-edge the siamese split, there are two big shoulders to remove and the front of the siamese split is very blunt in places. Ideally you'd be looking to have as shallow a split angle as possible, and the as little frontal area to the split as possible.</p> <p></p> <p>In the photo above, I've started knife edging the siamese split, and have opened out the right and left most port walls. The photo shows some of the typical places that flow gains can be made around the valve seats. Normally it's the valve seats where most of your flow gains will be made. With the V6 engine the inlet is so biased towards torque that you are likely to get good gains from increasing the port flow area; However, this can only be done if you are not running the C25XE plasting inlet manifold section.</p> <p>In the photo above, the short side radius defects can be shown. As the seat cutter enters the port, effectively smoothing the seat in part to the inlet port, it creates ridges on the short side radius. However, don't go taking too much material out of the short side radius because this will decrease the radius, and usually you will start to decrease flow ability because of increasing the turbulence. So, the rule is as little out of the port floor and short side radius as possible, but of course getting rid of the short side radius defects. Generally I just use some emery cloth along my finger and a few minutes with that is all it takes to correct the short side radius.</p> <p>The long side radius has the highest gas flow speed, and so it is more critical than the short side radius to get gains from. In the photo above you can see something that exists in all hemi-chamber heads (or at least all I've seen), and that's the void right before the valve seat which continues to just after the valve guide. The flash has highlighted (or shadowed) it well so that we can see it. The long side radius needs working to that this is a smooth radius into the port from the port mouth to the valve seat opening. This means removing quite a lot of material from the port roof right by the valve guide.</p> <p></p> <p>The inlet tract has been worked to smooth out the void on the long side radius and the short side radius is also blended. Actually, two things: (1) I took a bit too much out of the short side radius as I used a spiral band on a die-grinder to smooth it out rather than my normal emery cloth and finger method, and (2) I haven't really taken enough out of the port roof, there is still a slight dip.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The point is though, this is not an ultimate race head. If it was, I would have a bit more work to do. This level of porting is going to get the majority of ultimate flow through the head, and it means that I won't have to spend forever porting the heads, and I won't risk breaking through to a waterway and having to right a head off.</p> <p>It's important to know what work is worth doing and what is just superficial pub talk. The finish I got I'm really pleased with considering how long it's taken me to port the head which is probably only a couple of hours for this inlet port. Copying over to the rest of the inlets should not take too long at all.</p> <p>I used to use a drill for my porting work. All the heads I've done before have been done with a drill and a Flame shaped carbide burr, spiral bands and that's about it. However, today I used a die grinder and it's much quicker work. The burr is a lot quicker with a die grinder, you can really shift some material when you need to, it was particularly quick at doing the port roof.</p> <p>Finally, as can be seen with the guides, I've ported straight across the top. The guides are actually in really good nick, so I will just be deburring the guides and leaving them alone rather than replacing them with Trojan or Bronze ones. My \u00a350 engine is not looking too bad at all!</p>"},{"location":"v6manta/2008/2008-09-04-some-more-headwork/","title":"2008 09 04 some more headwork","text":"<p>v6manta</p>"},{"location":"v6manta/2008/2008-09-04-some-more-headwork/#2008-09-04-2008-09-04-some-more-headwork","title":"2008-09-04 - 2008-09-04 Some More Headwork","text":"<p>I have done some more work to the V6 heads.

No great deal though, the bellhousing is otherwise a really good fit.</p> <p>I also have to get a spigot bearing for the crank to support the gearbox input shaft.</p> <p>I got an old vectra sump (at least I think it was a vectra sump) for the V6 and milled it down to 35mm. This clears the mains girdle and will be the start of my dry sump pan. As I have the pump + oil tank, I might as well have a go at making the pan.</p> <p></p> <p>The &amp;quot;sump pan&amp;quot; bolted to the engine block shows that the pan clears the girdle fine, and when I place the engine in the car it will rest of \u00bc&amp;quot; of wood to give me a bit more space for making the sump pan. It is only very tight at the front of the engine where the subframe and steering rack are anyway. I will probably twin scavenge from the rear as I should be able to prevent forward oil surge under braking.</p> <p></p> <p>I started bolting the oil pump on, but there is a lug on the block that stops the oil pump being able to sit against the block properly. It was requiring 40mm spacers which really sucked.</p> <p></p> <p>The lug is just there for for block machining (i.e. in the factory as somewhere to clamp the casting), so I chopped it off.

This feeds straight into the outside area of the filter, which includes a pressure releif valve incase the filter gets blocked - this is probably designed to operate before the filters own pressure releif system which are generally flawed by the fact that when they releive, they push all of the previously filtered out debris straight into the main oil gallery feed!

It's probably easier to just look at the photos of them!</p> <p>I started off by milling down a Vectra sump. I think I milled it down to about 35mm, this clears everything that is under the engine. I have the subframe cutting across the front of the engine, right under the sump so I need to keep the sump as low as possible at the front of the engine.</p> <p>With what was left of the sump pan bolted to the block I chucked the block on a welding table and started rough cutting some 2mm aluminium to make the bottom of the dry sump pan. Luckily the windage tray bolts directly to the main cap girdle, so the sump pan is litterally just an oil catcher! I started off by cleaning all the aluminium. I cleaned the sump with thinners to get as much oil off the pan as I could, and then I gave everything a good scrub with a stainless wire brush. It is vital to get rid of all aluminium rust before trying to TIG anything.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Once I had the rough size done, I did a couple of tack welds to hold the plate in plate, and then profiled the plate with a die grinder to the same shape as the sump pan.

This was fine, but unfortunately I don't have an adjustment (pedal or finger control) for the current, so I could only go so far before the heat soak meant that the current was far too high. Then I would have to stop, wait a 30 seconds and start again. I think I'll definitely get a foot pedal for Matt's TIG. It would be very useful for ali. Initially, the heat arc was hard to predict and seemed a bit scattered. After a while I decided to snap the tungsten to weld with a new end, this helped a lot and when it had balled this new end was very concertrated and worked really well. I also moved the tungsten so that is was protruding about 2mm out the end of the shroud. Gas was Argoshield.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>In the end, the pan came out okay.

I radis around the seat area, trying to blend into the seat face without removing too much of the valve face or sinking any areas of it because otherwise you will need a big cut to get a sealing face.</p> <p>Then, you can just ask the machine shop for a light cut (about 1.5mm wide seat contact for the inlets) and once lapped in, the job's a good 'un.</p> <p>You can see a bit of paint from where I was matching the inlet to the manifolds, I'll clean the rest of that out at the weekend with some thinners.</p> <p>I went to Ring Engineering in Hayes, Middx to get the valve seats cut for a couple of reasons, and I can recommend them. Lapping the valves in has been easy, there aren't any bad cuts or nightmare seats. The reasons I went to Ring:</p> <li> When you ask for a light cut, the do what you ask and understand that they shouldn't cut out all your hard work! </li> <li> They can cut seats concentric with the valve guide, even when you have cutback the valve guild in the port. Some people can't do this because of how their seat cutting tools align with the guide. They need a flat surface on the end of the guide nearest the valve seat to align properly. </li>"},{"location":"v6manta/2010/2010-01-30-picked-up-another-v6/","title":"2010 01 30 picked up another v6","text":"<p>v6manta</p>"},{"location":"v6manta/2010/2010-01-30-picked-up-another-v6/#2010-01-30-2010-01-30-picked-up-another-v6","title":"2010-01-30 - 2010-01-30 Picked up another V6","text":"<p>Yep, me and Lee went on an eventful road trip today to pick up another V6 which I grabbed off of eBay for \u00a3100.</p> <p>I've stripped it down so that it is a short block, and the bottom end looks in good enough condition to use as the basis for my V6 engine in the Manta.

I removed both pump gears because I am running an external dry sump setup which has a pressure stage. The V6 can have both gears removed, the thrust washer behind the crank pulley sits against the drive for the oil pump inner gear so it all fits back together fine without the pump gears in. I had to modify the oil pump housing slightly to accept the poly-v alternator belt pulley that I'm using as it is off of a 20XE engine instead of the 25XE.

Here's some pretty photos of that:</p> <p></p> <p>I started the new engine up and it made good oil pressure, but I started it when it was the coldest day of the year to date, and with the oil pressure valve screwed to maximum it still only managed about 70psi which started to tail off when the oil started to warm (and I mean warm! Not Hot!).</p> <p>So I rang Titan Motorsport (The manufacturer of the oil pump) and they confirmed via the serial number that the pump has a \u215d\" pressure stage - good for a 2ltr 4-pot, but not big enough for a V6!</p> <p>So a new pump is on order, 0.8\" pressure and twin 0.9\" scavenges. But while I'm bored waiting for that to arrive I decided to get the handbrake cables fitted so the car has a working cable handbrake and also to improve the efficiency of the rad by ducting the front end.</p> <p></p> <p>I think that'll do a much better job of getting air through the rad, as the rad is sat so far back from the front of the car compared to std I was pretty sure the air through the rad would be pretty minimal. Plus when I was at the rollers last time, we struggled to get the thing cooling properly.
